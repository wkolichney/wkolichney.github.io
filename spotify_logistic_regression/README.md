# Predicting Spotify Skips
### Author: William Olichney
### About

This is a machine learning model that predicts whether a spotify user will skip a song based on the genre of the song, the time of day they listen to the song, the reason why the song started, whether the user is on shuffle mode, and whether incognito mode is turned on

This model is trained and only runs on my friend Brian's Spotify data.

## File Structure

**app.py** - a python file that loads the listening data, logistic regression model, and runs the streamlit dashboard

**requirements.txt** a text file of the package(s) that are necessary to run the streamlit dashboard
