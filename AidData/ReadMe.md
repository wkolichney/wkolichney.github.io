# AidData Workflow

### Author: William Olichney, Research Data Associate

#### Purpose:

I am a part of AidData's TUFF (Tracking Underreported Financial Flows) initiative, specifically under the Loan Performance team. These files are to organize better my workflows regarding many projects, such as leveraging LLMs to find or validate loan-level data, keeping track of exchange rate API code, coercing Google Sheet data entries into formats acceptable to our data quality assurance checks, and more.
