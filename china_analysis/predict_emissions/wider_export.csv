Both of these credits carried maturity periods of 8 years, and an interest rate greater than 0%. The People's Insurance Company of China provided overseas investment insurance for the project. The total cost of the project was approximately $34 million USD.  The purpose of this project was to construct a 24-megawatt hydroelectric power plant located at the confluence of the Alazani river and the Samkura river in Pankisi Valley. The power station was expected to annually generate 140 million kilowatt (kV) hours on average. At the time, Georgia had an electricity shortage issue, which the project sought to rectify. The project also sought to capitalize on potentially exporting power to Turkey, which also faces power shortages, in the future. The project was implemented on a Build-Own-Operate (BOO) basis and financed with a mix of debt and equity. As specified in a contract with the Georgian Government, SEPC would operate the station for 25 years and receive the financial returns from the station's power generation. If Khadori turned out to be profitable after the expiration of the 25-year contract period, SEPC would be given the choice to retain its ownership of it. The equity investment by SEPC that was made in the project, $34 million USD, is captured by linked project ID#42915.  Sichuan Electric Power Import and Export Corporation (SEPC) — a wholly-owned subsidiary of the State Grid Corporation of China — was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. Eastern Energy Corporation Ltd. also helped implement the project. Peri Ltd. was also active in implementation.

Hunan Sunny Hydropower Equipment Corporation (SHPE) provided 2x2700 kW Francis Turbine generator units.  The project began implementation on February 4, 2001, with a construction period of two years. The project completed and the hydropower station was connected to the Georgian power grid and put into commercial operation by then-President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili on November 20, 2004. Implementation had been slowed because of militant activity and by the new government of Georgia (which had been brought to power by the 2003 Rose Revolution), which refused to recognize an agreement on project implementation that the past government had made with Eastern Energy Corporation Ltd. The project was put into full operation on February 23, 2006. The power station has 60 employees; 50 are Georgian and 10 are Chinese.

54572,2009,"China Eximbank provides RMB 304 million government concessional loan for the 30MW Wadadli Power Plant Construction Project (linked to Project ID#54574)",2011,"Antigua and Barbuda","During the second half of 2006, the Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda, and others on behalf of the Government of Antigua and Barbuda and Antigua Public Utilities Authority (APUA), reportedly began discussions with Beijing Construction Engineering Group Co. Ltd (BCEG) about the possibility installing power generators in Antigua. These negotiations resulted in a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between APUA and BCEG signed on November 11, 2006. Then, on May 21, 2008, the Chinese Government and the Government of Antigua and Barbuda signed a preferential loan framework agreement for the 30MW Wadadli Power Plant Construction Project. Then, on June 26, 2008, China Eximbank and the Government of Antigua and Barbuda signed an RMB 300,000,000 (EC$ 117,690,000) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL No. (2008) 15 TOTAL NO. (234)] for the 30MW Wadadli Power Plant Construction Project. The GCL carries the following terms: a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 20.75 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, a 0.6% management fee, and a 0.5% commitment fee. The GCL’s final maturity date is March 21, 2029. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance a commercial contract between APUA and BCEG, which was signed on March 11, 2008. The loan's (principal) amount outstanding was EC$ 71,172,774 (or approximately RMB 167,759,220) as of September 2020.  The purpose of the project was to construct the 30MW Wadadli power plant — with six 5MW generators — in Crabbs, Antigua. Beijing Construction Engineering Group Co. Ltd. was the contractor responsible for project implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on October 2, 2008. The project was officially completed and handed over to the local authorities on September 8, 2011. Then, in 2012, the plant stopped working due to consistent overheating. Allegations arose that the power plant engines were used, rather than the new engines that Beijing Construction Engineering Group Co. Ltd. had promised. Another allegation emerged: that the engines only cost RMB 147 million and that the additional RMB 157 million was never allocated or misappropriated. The power plant already had rusting before the point of its commissioning in 2011 and it was decommissioned five years later (in 2016). Three of the units were brought back into use in 2017 at the cost of $6 million. However, one of the units failed again several years later.   In September 2020, APUA’s Electricity Business Unit Manager, Andre Matthias, announced that the power plant would be closing due to the conditions of the plant itself and its underperformance. In September 2020, the outstanding balance of the China Eximbank loan was EC$71,172,774 (or approximately RMB 167,759,220), which prompted questions and concerns about how the loan would be repaid in the absence of electricity sales from a functioning power plant. Antigua and Barbuda’s Information Minister Melford Nicholas said in September 2020 that ‘It is a tricky issue because as you would know the government enjoys a very good bilateral relationship with the People’s Republic of China and this represents a blot, represents a terrible outcome in terms of what should have been an effective developmental support for the infrastructure in the country. It really is a bad situation. […] I think the most that can happen now is for both parties to have a conversation as to what happens to the outstanding arrears and the debt that has been incurred and whether or not consideration will be given for it to be written off […] and whether or not there is a methodology of converting the debt into another form of development but it is not something that is an easy road to tread. […] We do not want to necessarily impair that relationship with the government of China and allow this particular issue to impair the relationship but clearly we have not gotten value for money […] and so something needs to be done and we will engage them effectively so that we can come to some sort of compromise.’"

However, the local authorities agreed to postpone its commissioning until December 31, 2016. Then, in January 2017, the opening of the facility was delayed by the Russian government for violations following an inspection. The facility was charged 78 million rubles for each following month the launch was delayed. The plant was ultimately put into operation on June 20, 2017. The plant now generates 3.02 billion KWH of electric energy and 814,000 Giga of heating supply annually. It has reportedly reduced Yaroslavl Oblast’s power deficit from 40-50% to 5-15% and it fully meets electricity demand during the winter season. The facility was built under a capacity supply agreement (CSA), which allows for a guaranteed return on investment, but includes penalties for delays in the opening o the facility."

Under the terms of the ‘resources-for-infrastructure’ agreement, TBEA Dushanbe Mining Company LLC agreed to ‘front’ $179 million for the construction of Phase 1 by borrowing directly from China Eximbank, and, in turn, the Tajik Government agreed to grant TBEA exclusive rights to explore and develop gold deposits at the Eastern Duoba mine and the Upper Kumarg mine (until TBEA could recoup its investment). The Tajik Government also reportedly agreed to give TBEA the rights to further mining deposits (at an unidentified location) if the profit made from the gold deposits at the Eastern Duoba mine and the Upper Kumarg mine did not cover the cost of Phase 1 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project. Also, as part of the ‘resources-for-infrastructure’ agreement, TBEA was reportedly exempted from paying customs duties and value added tax (VAT) on imported equipment necessary for exploration and development of the deposits. The tax and customs exemptions were scheduled to cease once TBEA recouped its initial costs. However, the agreement allowed TBEA to continue to mine the gold deposits for profit after the expiration of the exemptions.   Then, on November 7, 2014, the the Government of Tajikistan and the Export-Import Bank of China signed two loan agreements — a RMB 929,977,078 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2014) 30 TOTAL NO. (553)] and a $178,969,220 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2014) 40 TOTAL NO. (34)] for Phase 2 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project. The GCL is captured via Project ID#46211 and the PBC is captured via Project ID#71137. Both of these loans were ratified by the Tajik Parliament on January 14, 2015. The GCL was contracted by the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and it carried the following borrowing terms: a 25 year maturity, an 11 year grace period, and a 1.5% interest rate. The PBC carries a 20 year maturity, a 9 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. The Government of Tajikistan contributed $17,443,400 of counterpart financing. In total, the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan contracted $331,058,220 of China Eximbank debt for Phase 2 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project. The Government of Tajikistan used the proceeds of the GCL and the PBC to on-lend to Open Joint Stock Holding Company (OHSHC) “Barqi Tojik”. OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” was a state-owned enterprise in Tajikistan responsible for the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and thermal energy. The subsidiary GCL agreement (#TАJ 2014-028-2) was signed between Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” on December 18, 2014. It carried an interest rate of 5% and a maturity of 25 years. Its final maturity date was set to August 21, 2039. The subsidiary PBC agreement (#TАJ 2014-028-1) was also signed between Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” on December 18, 2014 and it carried an interest rate of 5% and a maturity of 20 years. Its final maturity date was set to June 21, 2034.   The PBC’s amount outstanding was TJS 808,004,000 as of December 31, 2016, TJS 1,343,913,000 as of December 31, 2017, TJS 1,436,962,000 as of December 31, 2018, TJS 1,476,217,000 as of December 31, 2019, and TJS 2,022,352,000 as of December 31, 2020. The GCL’s amount outstanding was TJS 1,054,408,000 as of December 31, 2016, TJS 1,259,654,000 as of December 31, 2017, TJS 1,274,255,000 as of December 31, 2018, TJS 1,288,762,000 as of December 31, 2019, and TJS 1,610,069,000 as of December 31, 2020.  Dushanbe 2 is a combined heat and power plant (CHP) — also known as the Dushanbe-2 Thermal Power Plant (TPS-2) — that provides heat and electricity for the residents of Dushanbe. It only operates in the winter. The 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project was designed and implemented in two phases. The power plant was to be fueled by coal, with the potential to switch to gas. Phase 1 (mainly constructed between 2012-2014) installed a capacity of 100 MW, while Phase 2 (constructed between 2014-2016) installed an additional capacity of 300 MW. TBEA was the general contractor responsible for implementation of both phases. Henan No 1 Thermal Power Construction Company was also involved in the implementation of Phase 1. Inner Mongolia Electric Power Survey and Design Institute Co., Ltd. was the contractor responsible for the design for Phase 2. Hydro Electric Power System Engineering Company was also involved in the implementation of Phase 2.   Phase 1 was originally scheduled to be completed and put into production before the celebration of the 20th anniversary of Tajik independence in 2011 (on September 9, 2011), and the second phase was scheduled to be completed in 2013. A formal groundbreaking ceremony for Phase 1 took place on September 8, 2009. However, construction did not begin until November 2012. Phase 1 was completed on September 13, 2014 and the first two (50MW) power generation units were put into operation on November 10, 2014. Phase 2 began on May 14, 2015 and was completed on December 8, 2016. According to President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon as relayed by TBEA, the power plant generates 9.6 million kWh power per day and 235 trillion Kcal heat, and it provides nearly 700 stable jobs to Tajiks. The electricity generated from the power plant is sold to Barki Tojik Open Stock Holding Power under a power purchase agreement. Through this project, 150 Tajik technicians went to China for training, and about 100 Tajik operators received professional know-how from Chinese experts. According to Xinhua, the completed power plant met 60 percent of the power demand and restarted the provision of central heating to more than 700,000 Dushanbe residents after 15 years of suspension. The completion of the power plant was declared to be a solution to Tajikistan's long-existing issue of power shortages during the winter.   However, it appears that the project’s second phase has encountered revenue generation and loan repayment problems. In 2018, the Government of Tajikistan reportedly granted a gold mining license to TBEA as ‘remuneration’ for Phase 2. Media reports indicate that TBEA agreed to work on the gold deposits as long as it takes to recoup the costs that it incurred during the construction of Phase 2. Several years later, in November 2021, TBEA Dushanbe Mining Company LLC reported that it had completed half of the work on the construction of the gold processing plant and ancillary facilities in Ayni district of the northern province of Sughd, Tajikistan. The purpose of these facilities is to support the development of the Kumarghi Bolo (Upper Kumargh) and Duobai Sharqi (Eastern Duoba) gold deposits. TBEA Dushanbe Mining Company LLC completed geological exploration works on the Upper Kumarg gold mine in October 2016.  There are also some indications that the China Eximbank loans for Phase 2 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project may have underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to a 2021 IMF report, ‘[OHSHC “Barqi Tojik”] has significant arrears to the government on [foreign exchange] denominated loans. The government on-lends concessional [foreign exchange] loans […] from multilateral and bilateral agencies to [OHSHC “Barqi Tojik”] on non-concessional terms. These loans are denominated in [foreign exchange] and are intended to develop the energy infrastructure. However, these debts are not serviced fully, resulting in [foreign exchange] arrears to the government.’ A 2021 report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) elaborated on this point, explaining that ‘[a] high rate of uncollected payments for electricity use due to illegal connections, power theft and outdated metering infrastructure contribute to the worsening financial health of Barki Tojik.’ Then, in March 2023, the IMF published a report, which noted that ‘[I]n 2021 the SOE sector […] kept accumulating debt service losses, where within a year the amount of debt overdue payments […] increased from TJS 14 billion to TJS 17 billion (17.1 percent of GDP). Some 93 percent of accumulated overdue debt belongs to [OHSHC “Barqi Tojik”].’"

Phase 1 (mainly constructed between 2012-2014) installed a capacity of 100 MW, while Phase 2 (constructed between 2014-2016) installed an additional capacity of 300 MW. TBEA was the general contractor responsible for implementation of both phases. Henan No 1 Thermal Power Construction Company was also involved in the implementation of Phase 1. Inner Mongolia Electric Power Survey and Design Institute Co., Ltd. was the contractor responsible for the design for Phase 2. Hydro Electric Power System Engineering Company was also involved in the implementation of Phase 2.   Phase 1 was originally scheduled to be completed and put into production before the celebration of the 20th anniversary of Tajik independence in 2011 (on September 9, 2011), and the second phase was scheduled to be completed in 2013. A formal groundbreaking ceremony for Phase 1 took place on September 8, 2009. However, construction did not begin until November 2012. Phase 1 was completed on September 13, 2014 and the first two (50MW) power generation units were put into operation on November 10, 2014. Phase 2 began on May 14, 2015 and was completed on December 8, 2016. According to President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon as relayed by TBEA, the power plant generates 9.6 million kWh power per day and 235 trillion Kcal heat, and it provides nearly 700 stable jobs to Tajiks. The electricity generated from the power plant is sold to Barki Tojik Open Stock Holding Power under a power purchase agreement. Through this project, 150 Tajik technicians went to China for training, and about 100 Tajik operators received professional know-how from Chinese experts. According to Xinhua, the completed power plant met 60 percent of the power demand and restarted the provision of central heating to more than 700,000 Dushanbe residents after 15 years of suspension. The completion of the power plant was declared to be a solution to Tajikistan's long-existing issue of power shortages during the winter.   However, it appears that the project’s second phase has encountered revenue generation and loan repayment problems. In 2018, the Government of Tajikistan reportedly granted a gold mining license to TBEA as ‘remuneration’ for Phase 2. Media reports indicate that TBEA agreed to work on the gold deposits as long as it takes to recoup the costs that it incurred during the construction of Phase 2. Several years later, in November 2021, TBEA Dushanbe Mining Company LLC reported that it had completed half of the work on the construction of the gold processing plant and ancillary facilities in Ayni district of the northern province of Sughd, Tajikistan. The purpose of these facilities is to support the development of the Kumarghi Bolo (Upper Kumargh) and Duobai Sharqi (Eastern Duoba) gold deposits. TBEA Dushanbe Mining Company LLC completed geological exploration works on the Upper Kumarg gold mine in October 2016.  There are also some indications that the China Eximbank loans for Phase 2 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project may have underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to a 2021 IMF report, ‘[OHSHC “Barqi Tojik”] has significant arrears to the government on [foreign exchange] denominated loans. The government on-lends concessional [foreign exchange] loans […] from multilateral and bilateral agencies to [OHSHC “Barqi Tojik”] on non-concessional terms. These loans are denominated in [foreign exchange] and are intended to develop the energy infrastructure. However, these debts are not serviced fully, resulting in [foreign exchange] arrears to the government.’ A 2021 report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) elaborated on this point, explaining that ‘[a] high rate of uncollected payments for electricity use due to illegal connections, power theft and outdated metering infrastructure contribute to the worsening financial health of Barki Tojik.’ Then, in March 2023, the IMF published a report, which noted that ‘[I]n 2021 the SOE sector […] kept accumulating debt service losses, where within a year the amount of debt overdue payments […] increased from TJS 14 billion to TJS 17 billion (17.1 percent of GDP). Some 93 percent of accumulated overdue debt belongs to [OHSHC “Barqi Tojik”].’"

The Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Cameroon agreed to provide the lender with a repayment guarantee (as defined in Article 1 of the BCL agreement). The borrower also purchased buyer's credit insurance from Sinosure. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the total cost ($637,136,492) of a commercial (EPC) contract between Cameroon’s Ministry of Water and Energy and Sinohydro Corporation, which was signed on April 12, 2012.   As of December 31, 2020, the loan (BCL) had achieved a 100% disbursement rate and the its outstanding amount was equivalent to CFA 203.4 billion.   The Memve'ele Hydroelectric Power Plant Project is a large-scale hydro-electric run-of-river dam and hydroelectric generator plant that involves a barrage that is 1,260 meters long and 14 meters high, with two overflow channels and a grand spillway to the generating plant. The dam site is around 26 square kilometers. The plant has four generators and turbines each. It is expected to inject 211 MW of electricity into Cameroon's energy supply network. The plant is located in Nyabizan on the Ntem River in the South region, 300 km from Yaounde. Sinohydro Corporation was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. On June 15, 2012, President Paul Biya presided over the ceremony to lay the foundation stone of the project. Construction was completed in August 2016.   Project ID#57586 captures a separate China Eximbank loan worth $141.8 million loan for Phase 2 of the 211 MW Memve'ele Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. The proceeds of this loan were used by the borrower for the construction of 294 pylons between Nyabizan and Ebolowa to evacuate 211MW of power from the Memve'ele dam to Yaounde, the installation of 225 KV transmission lines, and the construction and installation of three transformer substations with a capacity of 225/90 KV in the localities of Ebolowa, Nkoumou in the South Region and Ahala in the Centre Region. As of September 30, 2021, the construction of the Nyabizan-Yaoundé evacuation line had achieved a 92% completion rate. However, the completion of Phase 2 depends on payment of compensation to the people affected by the transmission line’s corridor. According to the Government of Cameroon, the revenue generated by the power plant and Nyabizan-Yaoundé transmission line since ‘powering up’ from April 2019 to October 2021 amounts to CFAF 45 billion. In addition, the partial completion of the 211MW Memve'ele Hydroelectric Power Plant Project has reportedly enabled the shutdown of the Ahala, Oyom-Abang, Mbalmayo and Ebolowa thermal power stations.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase 1 of the 211MW Memve'ele Hydroelectric Power Plant Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In January 2019, Cameroon unilaterally withheld debt service payments to China Eximbank. The lender responded by withholding new loan disbursements. Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon — with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 — by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) — or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed). Then, in January 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified the Government Cameroon as facing a high risk of debt distress. Eighteen months later, during an address before Cameroon’s National Assembly on June 28, 2021, the Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Esommba provided an update on the ICBC-financed Bini à Warak Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. He noted that the project had been 'on hold' since November 2019 because ICBC suspended the loan agreement, even though the Government of Cameroon had already mobilized XAF 22 billion of counterpart funding. He also explained that 'the reason for this suspension is that Cameroon did not settle some of its debts towards China on time, so, it is in a cross-default situation.’"

The project involved the construction of a rockfill dam, a 105-million cubic meters reservoir, a 15 MW power plant (with three, 5MW power generators), a 6.3/110KV interconnection substation in Mekin, a 110/30KV interconnection substation at Ndjom Yekombo, and a 110/30kV high-voltage transmission line from Mekin to Ndjom Yekombo (connected to the southern power grid). The dam and power plant are located in arrondissement of Meyomessala and electricity is evacuated to the eight districts of the Dja and Lobo Division, South Region. China National Electric Equipment Corporation was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. The Cameroonian Government also established a state-owned company -- called Hydro Mekin (or Hydromekin) -- to oversee implementation of the project. Project implementation commenced November 2011 and it was completed on December 23, 2015. However, after the facility was powered up in June 2019, it experienced technical difficulties. The facility was put back into production in May 2021 and it currently supplies the D31 Sangmélima and D32 Meyomessala feeders.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the 15MW Mekin Hydropower Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In January 2019, Cameroon unilaterally withheld debt service payments to China Eximbank. The lender responded by withholding new loan disbursements. Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon — with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 — by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) — or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed). Then, in January 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified the Government Cameroon as facing a high risk of debt distress. Eighteen months later, during an address before Cameroon’s National Assembly on June 28, 2021, the Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Esommba provided an update on the ICBC-financed Bini à Warak Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. He noted that the project had been 'on hold' since November 2019 because ICBC suspended the loan agreement, even though the Government of Cameroon had already mobilized XAF 22 billion of counterpart funding. He also explained that 'the reason for this suspension is that Cameroon did not settle some of its debts towards China on time, so, it is in a cross-default situation.’"

This loan carried the following borrowing terms: an interest rate of 6 month LIBOR plus a 4% margin, a 2% default (penalty) interest rate, a 15 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, a 0.8% commitment fee, and a 1% management fee. The Government of Honduras provided a sovereign guarantee for the loan on December 27, 2013.   The first ICBC loan disbursement (of $48 million) took place on August 10, 2015. As of November 2016, the loan had achieved an 89.8% disbursement rate ($267.4 million out of $297.7 million). The borrower (ENEE) made no principal payment and an interest payment worth $15.86 million in 2018. Then, in 2019, the borrower made a principal payment worth $14.76 million and an interest payment worth $17.21 million. The loan's (principal) amount outstanding was $266.41 million as of December 31, 2018 and $258.91 million as of December 31, 2019.  The purpose of the Patuca III project was to construct a hydroelectric dam in Patuca on the Rio Patuca in Olancho located in the south-eastern part of Honduras. The project involved the construction of a dam with a height of 57 meters, a shot and a pressure pipe creating a fall of 42.2 meters and a reservoir area of 51 square kilometers. At the end of the pipe is a surface house where two Kaplan turbines were to be installed. Construction of the project was expected to reduce dependence on expensive thermal energy and further diversify the country’s energy matrix. Upon completion, the project was expected have an estimated capacity of 104MW and is expected to generate 326 GWh per year. It was estimated that the completed project will serve a population of nearly one million people.   The project was completed in several stages. The first phase, which was completed in 2013, involved the design and construction of the cofferdam, diversion tunnel, bridge access, land acquisition and other complementary works at a cost of approximately $153.0 million. The second phase was executed at an estimated cost of $554.4 million. It consisted of the acquisition of generators, purchase and installation of two turbines, construction of the transmission line, installation of transformers, construction of the curtain and the reservoir, construction of the machine house, access roads, among others activities. The second phase was financed with funds from ENEE ($205.6 million), as well as loans to the Central Government from Bancatlan ($14.8 million), Petrocaribe ($36.1 million) and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China ($297.7 million).   The contractor responsible for project implementation is Sinohydro. Project implementation officially commenced on September 21, 2015. The Patuca III dam was officially inaugurated in January 2021. The project was originally scheduled to reach completion in the spring of 2018. However, the project faced implementation delays due the the fact that ENEE had trouble raising $35 million of additional funding to address a set of resettlement and environmental protections concerns before the dam could become operational.  A 2008 Honduran Government-sponsored environmental impact assessment (EIA) was 'so weak,' according to a 2012 letter from the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) to the Honduran Government, 'that we could not even envision starting to study [Tegucigalpa's request for project funding] seriously.' Among the failings the IADB’s EIA identified, the Honduran Government neither adequately consulted with nor compensated affected communities. According to the IADB, changes in the Patuca river’s flow also threatened several species of migrating fish, as well as lizards, crocodiles and turtles.  When the IADB declined to fund the 104MW Patuca III Dam Project, ICBC stepped in as an alternative source of financing.   The Patuca III Dam Project was plagued by accusations of corruption. The Honduran National Anti-Corruption Council investigated several officials at ENEE for the alleged embezzlement of more than $4 million from the construction of the barracks that housed Sinohydro’s technicians and laborers."

(黑山莫祖拉风电有限公司)— a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and joint venture of Malta Montenegro Wind Power JV Limited (90% equity stake) and Enemalta (10% equity stake) — signed an EUR 69,500,000 syndicated loan agreement with a group of banks for the 46MW Možura Wind Park Project. Known participants in the loan syndicate included Deutsche Bank and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC). The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to partially finance an EUR 90,000,000 commercial contract with Shanghai Electric Power Engineering Montenegro LLC.  The purpose of the project was to install 23 Chinese-made, 2 MW low-speed intelligent wind turbine generators — with a total installed capacity of 46,000 kW — in Možura within southern Montenegro. The project also involved the construction of a substation. The wind power plant was designed with a capacity of 46MW on 502,858 square meters of land at a cost of EUR 0.37 per square meter.   Shanghai Electric Power Engineering Montenegro LLC was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction formally commenced on December 7, 2017. Then on December 22, 2018, the first set of wind turbine generators was connected to the grid. By February 8, 2019, all of the wind turbine generators were connected to the grid. The wind farm began its trial operation period in April 2019, which extended until the end of September 2019. Following technical acceptance on November 15, 2019, the project secured a usage license from the Montenegrin Government. The wind farm went into commercial operation on November 18, 2019. Investors have leased state land to the project company (SPV) for a period of 20 years and will pay it an EUR 186,057 fee annually. The state has pledged to guarantee a fixed electricity price of EUR 95.99/MWh and EUR 115 million in incentives over the first 12 years of the wind farm’s operation. After the lease period expires, the Možura wind farm will become the property of the Montenegrin state.   Notwithstanding its successful completion, the Možura Wind Park Project has been plagued by controversy and scandal.  In the months before her murder in 2017, Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia was investigating an offshore company called 17 Black Limited. She didn’t know who owned the firm, which was registered in the United Arab Emirates. But she was certain it was set up to channel corrupt payments to Maltese political leaders. Caruana Galizia was killed in a car bombing in October 2017.  Then, in 2019, police charged one of Malta’s wealthiest businessmen, Yorgen Fenech — previously revealed by Reuters to be the owner of Limited — with ordering the murder of Caruana Galizia. He denied the charge. The assassination triggered a political crisis in Malta that drove Prime Minister Joseph Muscat from office in 2020.   17 Black Limited’s activities remain shrouded in mystery. But evidence uncovered by Reuters and the Times of Malta shed light on its operations through one particular deal. In December 2015, 17 Black Limited made a previously undisclosed profit of EUR 4.6 million ($5 million) when  Enemalta plc — a joint venture of the Government of Malta (67% ownership stake) and Shanghai Electric Power (33% ownership stake) — purchased an equity stake in the 46MW Možura Wind Park Project via Možura Wind Park d.o.o.. The purchase came after negotiations and several trips to Montenegro led by Malta’s then energy minister, Konrad Mizzi. In that same month, accountants for Mizzi and the prime minister’s then chief of staff, Keith Schembri, wrote in an email that Schembri and Mizzi stood to receive payments from 17 Black Limited for services that weren’t specified. Reuters and other news outlets have previously reported these emails, which were part of an application to open bank accounts for Panamanian firms owned by the two men. Keith Schembri confirmed to Reuters in April 2018 that companies he owns had devised a ‘draft business plan’ with 17 Black Limited that was not implemented, but he gave no further details. He is now under investigation for potential involvement in Caruana Galizia’s murder, police have said. He has denied any role in the journalist’s killing. Konrad Mizzi has previously stated he had no involvement in or knowledge of the plot to murder Caruana Galizia."

However, the project was finished ahead of schedule on May 27, 2018.  On July 22, 2018, the Barapukuria coal-fired power plant was shut down after the discovery of the “Barapukuria coal scam”, which was a corruption scandal concerning the misappropriation of around 142 hundred thousand tons of coal, worth over BDT 227 billion by officials of Barapukuria Coal Mining Company Limited (BCMCL) from the coal mine of Barapukuria, Dinajpur District, in northern Bangladesh. The scandal was revealed in July 2018 when a board member of the Bangladesh Power Development Board went to visit the coal mine and found no fresh coal whereas according to the document there should have been around 142 hundred thousand tons of coal reserved. The matter came to light when a Bangladeshi English-language daily reported the incident.   Petrobangla, the parent organization of the BCMCL, promptly suspended a few officials in this connection while the Anti-Corruption Commission started an inquiry to trace the corruption. Barapukuria's coal-fired power plant suspended its operations due to the shortage of coal as an immediate effect of the corruption scandal. Before the shutdown of the plant, it had been supplying around 380MW power to the national grid on an average. When the power plant shut down the first time, the people of eight northern districts of Rangpur and Dinajpur regions suffered from a lack of electricity.  BPDB then decided to restart one of its units for five days on August 20, 2018. On August 28, 2018, the plant shut down again."

Principal and interest is payable in 23 semi-annual installments. Interest is also payable semi-annually during the grace period. The loan is collateralized in that the 1320MW Payra coal-fired power plant facility has been mortgaged to the lender. The borrower is also required to maintain a minimum cash balance in a Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA). As an additional credit enhancement, the Government of Bangladesh issued a $1 billion sovereign guarantee in support of the loan on December 31, 2017.   The borrower made three principal repayments worth $64,946,000 in financial year 2020-2021 (July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021) and $136,333,396 in financial year 2021-2022  (July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022). However, the borrower struggled to meet its repayment obligation during the second half of calendar year 2022.   The borrower failed to pay the fourth (scheduled) installment of principal and interest (worth $114 million) to the lender on December 8, 2022, which raised questions about a possible default and BCPCL's ability to secure a follow-on loan from China Eximbank for the Second Phase of 1320MW Payra Coal-Fired Thermal Power Plant Project. AM Khorshedul Alam, Managing Director of BCPCL, told a local media outlet at the time that his organization had the entire month of December 2022 to pay the fourth installment. China Eximbank reportedly issued an invoice amounting to $114 million due on December 8, 2022. But when BCPCL asked its 'account bank' – Sonali Bank – to make the payment, Sonali Bank said it was not in a position to provide such a large amount of US dollars. Following Sonali Bank's reply, the BCPCL wrote a letter to the Secretary of Bangladesh's Power Division on December 1, 2022, requesting its assistance by notifying the Forex Reserve and Treasury Management Department of the country's central bank (Bangladesh Bank) through the Finance Division to provide the required U.S. dollars to the bank account before December 8, 2022 at the Bangladesh Bank rate. 'The Ministry of Finance issued a sovereign guarantee of around $1 billion favouring the lender to secure this loan repayment. Failure to pay 4th loan [installment] may result in country default,' reads the letter. BCPCL also noted that '[I]f we failed to pay the loan [installment in a timely manner], loan financing for the 2nd phase of the project may be seriously threatened.' Two weeks earlier, on November 13, 2022, BCPCL wrote to the Forex Reserve and Treasury Management Department of the Bangladesh Bank and the Power Division to request help accessing the U.S. dollars needed to make loan repayments and coal import-related payments. 'The Bangladesh Bank is the only source that has the capability to support our huge forex liquidity requirement, BCPCL wrote in its letter. BCPCL also noted in its November 13, 2022 letter to the Power Division and the Bangladesh Bank that, that apart from the China Eximbank loan installment, it had $94.84 million in overdue coal import bills as of November 2022 (that were being financed through a deferred payment facility with CMC that carries a 3.25% interest rate and 6-month maturity).

The purpose of the project was to construct a 350-megawatt (MW) coal-fired power station in the Nishanbaria village of Taltali upazila within Barguna district and Barisal division.   Shanghai Electric Power Construction Company Limited (SEPC) was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Satellite imagery demonstrates that preliminary construction activities began between January 2019 and November 2019. Construction of a 217-meter chimney started on December 16, 2020. Then, in February 2022, the lifting of the steel inner tube of the chimney was completed, marking the completion of the main chimney at the power plant. The power plant’s 400kV electricity transmission line was completed on May 19, 2022. The power plant was connected to the national grid on October 29, 2022. The power plant was originally scheduled to reach its commercial operation date (COD) on January 12, 2022. It passed its 168-hour reliability test and began commercial operations on December 31, 2022. Satellite imagery from December 2022 revealed a plume at the project site.   The project became a source of local controversy and public opposition. On August 2, 2018, villagers submitted a public petition to the Prime Minister urging the government to stop the project, alleging that BEPCL was purchasing lands with the help of illegal brokers with forged documents. In October 2018, the government said it would investigate the claims. In February 2019, Transparency International Bangladesh again called on the government to halt the plant's construction, claiming that the project had no approval from Bangladesh's Department of Environment — as well as claiming that local residents who have filed claims for compensation over land acquisition have been threatened and even assaulted. A study conducted by civil society organization the Bangladesh Working Group on External Debt (BWGED) says 153 families were directly impacted by the construction of the coal power plant. Of them, 142 were reportedly evicted by force. The BWGED study also noted that, when operational, the power station would emit 7,081 tonnes of carbon a day and damage several rich ecological zones nearby, including Tengragiri Wildlife Sanctuary, Sonakata Eco Park, Laldia mangrove forest, and Fatrar Char mangrove forest. It also raised the fear that hot water released from the plant into the Payra river would have negative effects on the hilsa population. Barges carrying coal to the plant will also reportedly move through a hilsa breeding ground. Hilsa is not only the favorite fish of Bangladesh but also a major revenue earner through exports. In May 2022, Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) found substantive corruption involving the power plant."

The loan is subject to an interest rate of 7.15% per annum for 60 months from the date of agreement and after 60 months the interest rate is set to LIBOR plus a margin of 3.2% per annum. The loan is repayable over a period of 14 years in 24 equal semi-annual installments. The first loan repayment was scheduled for March 20, 2012 (3 year grace period) and the last loan repayment was scheduled for September 20, 2023. Fiji’s Ministry of Finance issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan and on behalf of the Government of Fiji. The borrower was to use the proceeds of the loan to partially finance a $124.8 million commercial contract that it signed with Sinohydro Corporation Limited on September 8, 2008.   On January 27, 2009, the FEA made the first drawdown from the China Development Bank loan amounting to $43.8 million. Immediately upon receipt of the loan proceeds from China Development Bank, on January 28, 2009, FEA sold $13.8 million to Reserve Bank of Fiji, thereby settling the FEA’s commitment to Reserve Bank of Fiji (see Staff Note 2). The balance of the loan proceeds ($30 million) was placed in short term foreign currency term deposits with ANZ Bank. FEA made its last loan drawdown ($11.2 million) in March 2010  after satisfying all the three debt covenants essential to ensure the loan drawdown. Additional funding for the 41.7MW Nadarivatu Hydropower Project was secured via FEA bonds ($50 million), and ANZ Bank ($30 million).   The purpose of this project was to construct the Nadarivatu Dam, also known as the Korolevu Dam, which is a concrete gravity dam on the upper reaches of the Sigatoka River in Buyabuya Village, Nadarivatu District, and Nadroga-Navosa Province. The dam was designed to generate hydroelectric power in a 41.7 megawatts (55,900 hp) run-of-the-river scheme. The 40-meter-high concrete gravity dam, including three radial gates and two sluice gates, diverts water from the confluence of the Nukunuku River and Qaliwana River, which are tributaries of Sigatoka River, through a 3,225 m long headrace/2-meter-diameter buried steel penstock tunnel to a power station along the Ba River to the southwest. The power station contains two 20.85 MW Pelton (with 6 jet-units) turbine-generators with a maximum discharge of 15.0 m3 /s. The drop in elevation between the reservoir and the power station affords a gross head of 335.7 m. A 132 kV, 5-kilometer-long transmission line connects it to the existing FEA’s transmission system through a switching station (known as the Nadarivatu Switching Station). The Nadarivatu Switching Station connects to the national power grid and is situated near the 132kV Wailoa - Vuda transmission line.  The design services for the project were undertaken by MWH New Zealand Limited. Detailed plans for the project were developed in 2002; detailed design work and construction of basic infrastructure such as access roads for the 42 MW Nadarivatu hydropower project were completed in 2006.  Then, on December 17, 2008, FEA made an advance payment of $43.8 million was made to Sinohydro Corporation Limited, which resulted in it mobilizing a workforce for the construction of the project. Construction began in January 2009.   The power station was ultimately commissioned on September 7, 2012, and an inauguration ceremony led by Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama was held a week later on September 14, 2012.   The completion of the power station was expected to save the country about 42 million Fiji dollars ($24 million) per year from the importation of diesel fuel.  However, the project was not without controversy. In March 2009, local landowners and the Construction Energy and Timber Workers Union (which represented local workers supporting the construction of the power plant) raised concerns over Sinohydro Corporation Limited's non-compliance with the occupational health and safety laws of Fiji. Nadarivatu Landowner Council secretary Misaele Toutou also said that when villagers from five clans started work in January 2009, they were not provided proper safety gear from boots, gloves and helmets. The General Secretary of the Construction Energy and Timber Workers Union said that Sinohydro Corporation Limited was extensively abusing local workers by not providing essential safety gear and proper working conditions that they deserved. He said workers had been exploited and asked to work under dangerous and hazardous conditions without safety clothing and equipment; and directed to get their own safety gear if they wanted jobs on the project. Local employees reportedly staged protests about a lack of compliance with health and safety laws. Union representatives and a local landowners council also wrote to the Immigration Department to ask for explanations about increases in the number of foreign workers."

The borrowing terms of the supplier’s credit were as follows: 15-year maturity period, 4-year grace period, 5.66% interest rate, and 6.59% insurance premium. The borrower was to use the proceeds from the supplier’s credit to finance 80% of the $135.5 million cost of a commercial (EPC) contract between NORINCO and EDL, which was signed in 2004a. In order to finance its supplier’s credit agreement with the Government of Laos, NORINCO secured an export seller’s credit from China Eximbank.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 76MW hydropower plant along the Xeset River. The project was a run-of-river scheme with a gross head of 271 meters and an installed capacity of 76MW. The surface powerhouse was to be equipped with two Francis type turbines with an installed capacity of38 MW each. Both the generators and the turbines were manufactured by Dongfang and the generators had a designed operation lifetime of 30 years. The power plant was expected to generate an average annual production of 309,000 MWh.   The project site is located on the upper Xeset River about 10 km above the Xeset 1 head pond (river distances). The Xeset II head pond collects the flow from both the Xeset and the Houay Tapoung diversion which then enters the head pond on the bank of the Xeset. The project consisted of a concrete overflow dam (114 m long x 23 m high) with an intake structure and two radial flushing gates. The head pond has an active volume of 800,000 m³ which is to be used for daily peaking. The intake is situated on the right bank of head pond and leads to a 1.5 km long open canal with a gated intake, trash rack and trash rack cleaner, a 6.8 km long headrace tunnel with a 19.67 m2 to 26.30 m2 cross section, a 1.49 km long steel penstock, a surface powerhouse and a 200 m long tailrace. A vertical surface venting surge tank is located just upstream of the steel penstock. The combined catchment area for the Xeset II Hydropower Project is 392 km². The powerhouse discharge is 33.7m³/s.   The powerhouse is designed to drain to the Xeset 1 head pond via a 200 m long tailrace. Access to the powerhouse and associated switchyard was to be linked to both the 115kV transmission line to Paksong and connect to Xeset 1 switch yard by a 115 kV line. The Xeset II powerhouses were to be connected via a 37 km long double-circuit 115kV transmission line from the switch yard of Xeset II to Paksong. This was to be linked to the southern supply area at Chiengxai (Ban Jianjxay) Substation. The linkage was designed to increase reliability and guaranteed electricity supply to the southern Lao and the EGAT Grid System in Thailand. A 3.1 km long 115kV transmission line was also to link the switch yards between Xeset II and Xeset 1. The Chiengxai substation was to be be connected to Bangyo substation which is in turn connected to the EGAT Grid.   The precise locational coordinates of the Xeset II powerhouse are 15°29'15.67"N and 106°16'58.87"E.

The PBC carries the following borrowing terms: a 20-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. It is backed by a sovereign repayment guarantee from Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Finance. An initial loan disbursement of $79.8 million took place on October 31, 2014, leaving a balance of $239.7 million to be disbursed in multiple tranches between 2015 and 2017. The loan’s amount outstanding was $214,554,588 as of December 31, 2016 and $273,700,750 as of December 31, 2017. Its amount outstanding (including principal, interest, and arrears) was $305,331,749.40 as of September 2021.   Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Finance used the proceeds from the PBC to on-lend to Kariba Hydro Power Company (Private) Limited (KHPC), which is a special purpose vehicle (project company) that is wholly owned by Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC). KHPC entered into power purchase agreements (PPAs) with Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company (ZETDC) and Nampower. It planned to service the China Eximbank PBC with revenue derived from power sales to ZETDC and Nampower. The lender required the borrower to maintain a minimum cash balance of $32 million in multiple, lender-controlled escrow accounts: $26 million in a Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA) and $6 million in a Maintenance Reserve Account (MRA). ZPC also agreed to make a $35 million equity contribution to support the project’s implementation.    This project involved an expansion of the existing 750MW Kariba South hydropower station. The purpose of the expansion was to increase the installed capacity of the Kariba South hydropower station through the addition of two additional units of 150MW each, resulting in an aggregate 1,050MW installed capacity. The Kariba dam is situated in the Zambezi river basin between Zambia and Zimbabwe. There are two hydropower stations at the dam: the Kariba North hydropower station, which is owned by Zambia, and the Kariba South hydropower station, which is owned by Zimbabwe. Kariba South was commissioned in 1962, and it generates electricity from water drawn from Lake Kariba, forcing it through a short intake and vertical penstock to a turbine where hydroelectric power is produced in the coupled generator. The water is then discharged downstream back into the Zambezi river. Sinohydro Bureau 16 Co., LTD was the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor responsible for implementation of the Kariba South Hydro Project. A groundbreaking ceremony for this project took place on September 4, 2014, and a project completion ceremony was held on March 28, 2018. During the construction process, Sinohydro Bureau 16 Co., LTD reportedly hired and trained local employees and brought more than 3,000 job opportunities to Zimbabwe.    However, the power plant encountered operational challenges after it was constructed and the borrowing institution (KHPC) has breached its contractual obligations with China Eximbank. In a 2016 Report on Parastatals and State Enterprises, Zimbabwe’s Accountant and Auditor General noted that KHPC and ZPC were in breach of contract for not depositing the cash proceeds from the power purchase agreement into a China Eximbank-controlled escrow account. The report concluded that ‘[c]ontrary to the terms set out in the escrow agreement, ZPC power purchase agreement proceeds have not been paid into the said account by ZPC. ZPC confirmed a netted inter-company balance implying that the power proceeds payable to KHPC are being set-off against inter-company receivables from KHPC.’ Then, on November 25, 2022, Munyaradzi Munodawafa, the Chief Executive Office Zambezi River Authority — an entity responsible for the Kariba Dam that is jointly owned by Zimbabwe and neighboring Zambia — sent a letter to Zimbabwe Power Company, which noted that water levels at the Kariba South hydroelectric power facility were at record low levels and electricity generation activities could no longer continue.

The main dam was finished before the 2011 rainy season, and the auxiliary dam and spillway capacity were completed one year later. In 2012, the European consulting firm Pöyry accepted a two-year contract with CTHL to provide monitoring of dam engineering, design, construction, quality, materials, and safety until 2014. As of February 8, 2012, construction was reportedly 20% complete. The access tunnel was completed in February 2013. Then, on June 23, 2013, Cambodia experienced 50-year monsoonal rains, flooding the project and suspending much of the construction. CHMC quickly deployed rescue workers to move construction equipment and build dikes. By the next day, the flood was under control and the damage contained. By the fall of 2013, the main dam passed the gate-closing requirements as determined by a Chinese team of experts and reviewed by Pöyry. After approval, the gate was closed and water storage officially began on November 16, 2013. The diversion tunnels for both dams were also finished in November 2013.   The originally expected project completion date was November 30, 2013; however, the first of the dam’s three 82MW generators did not begin to produce electricity until August 13, 2014. CHMC Board Chairman and President Mr. Lu Wenjun, and Mr. Zhu Xu attended a grid connection and commissioning ceremony on August 13, 2014. By December 2015, all three 82MW generators were active and the dam was fully operational. A project acceptance and power generation ceremony took place on December 23, 2015. The ceremony was attended by both Prime Minister Hun Sen and Chinese Ambassador to Cambodia Bu Jianguo. Then, in November 2019, China Eximbank conducted an on-site, post-loan inspection. Under terms of a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), China National Heavy Machinery Corporation (CHMC), the majority shareholder of project owner and operator CTHL’s parent company, sells the electricity generated by the power plant at 7.45 cents per kilowatt-hour to EDC, thereby generating approximately $12 million of tax revenue a year. All electric power generated by the hydropower station is sent to the Phnom Penh-Battambang transmission and distribution lines. Since operationalization, the dam’s three generators have had an average annual production capacity of 849 GW*h14 that, in 2020, represented almost 24 percent of Cambodia’s total hydropower generation (3,493 GW*h) and 10 percent of Cambodia’s total domestic electricity production (8,513 GW*h). The 246MW Stung Tatay Hydroelectric Power Plant Project qualified for Certified Emission Reduction (CER) credits via the CDM under the UNFCCC as a renewable power source. The CDM credit system projected the dam would provide an annual greenhouse gas emission reduction of 393,329 tons of CO2 equivalents. The CER credits guaranteed by the project were then sold to the Netherlands via Gazprom Marketing & Trading Singapore between September 2013 and 2020. The project was recently re-certified by Shenzhen CTI International Certification to allow the same credits to be sold to the Netherlands for the next seven years between September 2020 to August 2027."

Ltd. — a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and wholly-owned subsidiary of China Electric Power Technology Import-Export Corp. (CETIC) — signed an implementation agreement for the 18MW Kirirom III Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project. On the same day, Électricité du Cambodge (EDC) and CETIC International Hy­dro­power Development Co. Ltd. signed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). CETIC is a subsidiary of State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC).  Under these two agreements, CETIC International Hy­dro­power Development Co. Ltd. was granted a 30-year build-operate-transfer (BOT) concession and the Government of Cambodia provided a guarantee to CETIC International Hy­dro­power Development Co. Ltd. that it would purchase any power produced by the Kirirom III plant in the event of non-payment by EDC.  In order to facilitate the implementation of the $66.53 million project, China Eximbank reportedly issued a loan worth $47.1 million to CETIC International Hy­dro­power Development Co. Ltd. in 2008. The purpose of the project was to install two additional 9MW power generation units at the existing Kirirom Hydroelectric Power Plant (‘Kirirom I’) in Koh Kong Province. CETIC constructed Kirirom I with an earlier loan from China Eximbank (captured in linked ProjectID#32080).  A feasibility study for the 18MW Kirirom III Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project was completed in 2004. Construction started on March 5, 2009, and the expanded power plant was put into operation on April 24, 2012. The plant was officially inaugurated on February 23, 2013. Upon completion, the power plant was capable of generating 78 million kilowatt-hours each year.   However, this project was plagued by scandal after its completion. Chen Chun Lin, a Chinese accountant for CETIC International Hy­dro­power Development Co. Ltd., was sentenced to more than four years in jail in early 2016 for embezzling nearly $2 million from his employer by writing and depositing company checks and then withdrawing the funds for personal use. Phnom Penh Municipal Court sentenced him to 4.5 years in jail on charges of ‘breach of special trust by administrators’.  Mr. Chen Chun Lin was ordered to repay the $1.93 million he stole from the CETIC International Hy­dro­power Development Co. Ltd., and pay approximately $50,000 in damages. During his trial, Chen Chun Lin confessed to secretly writing 52 checks over the course of 2015 and then proceeding to withdraw money from a company bank account once the checks were cleared. When the judge asked him how he used the money, he replied: “I used it for gambling. I subsequently spent it all in gambling since early 2015”. Chen Chun Lin was imprisoned on December 26, 2015. Tip Janvibol, the lawyer representing CETIC, said Chen Chun Lin had worked for the company for six years and that he was in charge of managing all the company’s funds."

(PCR) —  signed a $206,432,000 buyer’s credit loan agreement for the 194.1MW Kamchay Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. The loan carries a 15-year maturity, a 4-year maturity, and an annual interest rate of 12-month LIBOR plus a 1% margin. It was backed by a Sinosure insurance policy and secured by (i.e. collateralized against) with account pledge agreement, an insurance policy pledge agreement, and a land and building mortgage agreement, among other things. The proceeds of the loan were used to partially finance a commercial (EPC) contract PowerChina's subsidiary, Sinohydro Group, signed with the Cambodian Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy, and Electricite du Cambodge on February 23, 2006.   The total cost of this 44-year Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) project was $280,500,000. 72% of the project cost was covered through China Eximbank debt financing (captured in this project) and 28% of the project cost was covered through equity (captured in Project ID#65326).   The purpose of the project was to construct a 194.1MW hydroelectric power plant (with eight power generation units) in Bokor National Park (BNP), which is an extension of the Cardamom Mountains in the Elephant Mountain Range in southwestern Cambodia on the Kamchay River. The nearest city to the project site is the provincial town of Kampot, which is about 15km downstream of the river and 150km from Phnom Penh. Upon completion, the plant was expected to have a total installed capacity of 193,200 kilowatts. The electricity generated by the plant was to be connected through the Kampot Switching Station to the Phnom Penh Grid.   Sinohydro Kamchay Hydroelectric Project Co., Ltd. served as the Project Owner, the Project Contractor, the Project Operator.  A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on April 8, 2006. It was attended by Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao and the Prime Minister of Cambodia Hu Sen. However, construction did not begin until September 18, 2007. All 8 power generation units were put into operation on December 7, 2011. Then, on August 1, 2012, commercial power generation metering commenced. During project implementation, 2,015 hectares of protected forest were lost due to the flooding for the reservoir, and a total area of 2,291 hectares was destroyed. As the dam was located in a national park, no resettlement was required because there were no villages located upstream of the dam. However, the flooded area was a mixed bamboo forest, which provided raw materials for basket-making, rattan, and wild fruits, which contributed to the livelihoods of the poorer families located downstream.  Under terms of the BOT agreement, Sinohydro sells the electricity generated by the Kamchay Hydroelectric Power Plant to the Electricite du Cambodge. The concession period is 44 years (4 years for construction and 40 years for operation). After the expiration of the concession operation period, the project facilities will be transferred to the Cambodian Government free of charge."

However, the ADB did not follow up on the project due to its marginal financial viability and its potentially serious environmental and social impacts, especially on migratory fish stocks and fishing livelihoods. Then, in June 2007, the Ministry of Industry, Mines, and Energy (MIME) of Cambodia granted permission for Electricité du Viet Nam (EVN) to conduct a detailed feasibility study. The study was implemented by a consulting firm, Power Engineering Consulting Joint Stock Company 1 (PECC1), in collaboration and consultation with technical ministries/agencies of the Royal Government of Cambodia. Then, on November 26, 2012, The Government of Cambodia and Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. — a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and joint venture of the Royal Group of Cambodia (39%), Hydrolancang International Energy (51%), and Vietnam Electricity (EVN) (10%) — signed an implementation agreement (IA) for the 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project. On the same day, Électricité du Cambodge (EDC) and Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd signed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). Under these two agreements, Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. was granted a 45-year concession (40 years of operation and a construction period of 5 years) and it was specified that the electricity generated by Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. — through the Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant — would be sold to EDC at the fixed price of 6.95 US cents per kilowatt-hour. These agreements also specified that, after 40 years of operation, the ownership of the Lower Sesan II dam will be transferred to the Government of Cambodia. On December 12, 2012, the Government of Cambodia also agreed to guarantee the payment (power purchase) obligations of EDC and Cambodia’s Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy to Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd under the PPA and the IA.  The total cost of the 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project, which was implemented on a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) basis, was $978 million and it was financed with a mix of debt and equity. In December 2013, China Development Bank (captured via Project ID#62217), ICBC (captured via Project ID#92481), and Bank of China (captured via Project ID#92483) provided a $781 million debt financing package (with a 17-year maturity and an interest rate of 6.5%) to Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. for the 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project. The financing was structured in the 2 tranches: (i) an initial bridge financing with ICBC under a financial leasing structure (the first for an infrastructure project in Cambodia); and (ii) a subsequent project financing by China Development Bank and Bank of China. Sinosure provided credit insurance. The Government of Cambodia issued a sovereign guarantee in the event on non-payment by EDC.  The purpose of this project was to construct a hydroelectric power plant in the northeastern province of Stung Treng on the Se San River. Its locational coordinates are 13°32′59.5″N 106°15′49.4″E. The Lower Sesan II Dam is 80 meters tall and occupies a 36,000-hectare plot. The plant has eight turbines and each turbine has an installed capacity of 50 megawatts (400 MW total capacity). Upon completion, the plant was expected to produce 1.9 billion kilowatt-hours per year, boost electricity production in the country by 20%, and bring installed hydropower capacity to 1328MW.  PowerChina HuaDong Engineering Corporation Limited (HDEC) was the contractor responsible for project design. Sinohydro Bureau 8 Co., Ltd was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began in December 2013. The watergate was officially closed on September 25, 2017. The first turbine began producing electricity in November 2017. The dam was officially opened on December 18, 2018.   The Chinese banks that financed the project divided environmental and social risks control into specific segments, including pre-loan investigation, loan review, contract management, loan issuance and post-loan management. They also required an environmental impact assessment (EIA) after the completion of the project. CDB went even further by introducing a standard review procedure. Sinosure also required that the project developer pay special attention to social and environmental responsibilities -- in particular, by resolving controversies around the dam through public consultation. The project developer held several public consultations with the affected communities in line with the guidelines of the Chinese banks. In July 2015, as requested by the local staff members of the CDB, the project developer held a dialogue with 140 people representing communities affected by the 400MW Lower Sesan II hydropower plant, Cambodian government representatives at national and sub-national levels, and NGOs to discuss their concerns and other issues related to the project. The participants then paid a visit on July 27, 2014 to the resettlement site to inspect on the quality of the housing construction, agricultural land, and dam construction. During the visit, community representatives and media held an informal on-site dialogue and raised questions to the Ministry of Mine and Energy’s secretary of state, project development, and the Stung Treng Deputy Governor in charge of Resettlement and Compensation Committee.   Nevertheless, the project was affected by protests from thousands of villagers who were at risk of being displaced or losing their livelihoods. On February 13, 2014, villagers living in the dam reservoir lodged a petition to the Chinese embassy in Phnom Penh, relevant ministries of the Cambodian government, and the developer to discuss compensation and resettlement conditions in detail. On August 10, 2021, Human Rights Watch released a report about the various ways in which the 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project allegedly harmed the lives and livelihoods of thousands of indigenous and ethnic minority people. The report claims that the construction of the Lower Sesan 2 dam displaced nearly 5,000 people without adequately providing compensation or livelihood assistance. It also notes that, although by community members occurred during the dam’s construction between 2011 and 2018, public officials ignored the complaints and moved forward with the construction project."

These agreements also specified that, after 40 years of operation, the ownership of the Lower Sesan II dam will be transferred to the Government of Cambodia. On December 12, 2012, the Government of Cambodia also agreed to guarantee the payment (power purchase) obligations of EDC and Cambodia’s Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy to Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd under the PPA and the IA.  The total cost of the 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project, which was implemented on a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) basis, was $978 million and it was financed with a mix of debt and equity. In December 2013, China Development Bank (captured via Project ID#62217), ICBC (captured via Project ID#92481), and Bank of China (captured via Project ID#92483) provided a $781 million debt financing package (with a 17-year maturity and an interest rate of 6.5%) to Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. for the 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project. The financing was structured in the 2 tranches: (i) an initial bridge financing with ICBC under a financial leasing structure (the first for an infrastructure project in Cambodia); and (ii) a subsequent project financing by China Development Bank and Bank of China. Sinosure provided credit insurance. The Government of Cambodia issued a sovereign guarantee in the event on non-payment by EDC.  The purpose of this project was to construct a hydroelectric power plant in the northeastern province of Stung Treng on the Se San River. Its locational coordinates are 13°32′59.5″N 106°15′49.4″E. The Lower Sesan II Dam is 80 meters tall and occupies a 36,000-hectare plot. The plant has eight turbines and each turbine has an installed capacity of 50 megawatts (400 MW total capacity). Upon completion, the plant was expected to produce 1.9 billion kilowatt-hours per year, boost electricity production in the country by 20%, and bring installed hydropower capacity to 1328MW.  PowerChina HuaDong Engineering Corporation Limited (HDEC) was the contractor responsible for project design. Sinohydro Bureau 8 Co., Ltd was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began in December 2013. The watergate was officially closed on September 25, 2017. The first turbine began producing electricity in November 2017. The dam was officially opened on December 18, 2018.   The Chinese banks that financed the project divided environmental and social risks control into specific segments, including pre-loan investigation, loan review, contract management, loan issuance and post-loan management. They also required an environmental impact assessment (EIA) after the completion of the project. CDB went even further by introducing a standard review procedure. Sinosure also required that the project developer pay special attention to social and environmental responsibilities -- in particular, by resolving controversies around the dam through public consultation. The project developer held several public consultations with the affected communities in line with the guidelines of the Chinese banks. In July 2015, as requested by the local staff members of the CDB, the project developer held a dialogue with 140 people representing communities affected by the 400MW Lower Sesan II hydropower plant, Cambodian government representatives at national and sub-national levels, and NGOs to discuss their concerns and other issues related to the project. The participants then paid a visit on July 27, 2014 to the resettlement site to inspect on the quality of the housing construction, agricultural land, and dam construction. During the visit, community representatives and media held an informal on-site dialogue and raised questions to the Ministry of Mine and Energy’s secretary of state, project development, and the Stung Treng Deputy Governor in charge of Resettlement and Compensation Committee.   Nevertheless, the project was affected by protests from thousands of villagers who were at risk of being displaced or losing their livelihoods. On February 13, 2014, villagers living in the dam reservoir lodged a petition to the Chinese embassy in Phnom Penh, relevant ministries of the Cambodian government, and the developer to discuss compensation and resettlement conditions in detail. On August 10, 2021, Human Rights Watch released a report about the various ways in which the 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project allegedly harmed the lives and livelihoods of thousands of indigenous and ethnic minority people. The report claims that the construction of the Lower Sesan 2 dam displaced nearly 5,000 people without adequately providing compensation or livelihood assistance. It also notes that, although by community members occurred during the dam’s construction between 2011 and 2018, public officials ignored the complaints and moved forward with the construction project."

As of May 17, 2017, the power plant had generated 5.2 billion kilowatt hours, accounting for 40% of Bali's total power supply and allowing Bali to stop relying on power generation and supply from Java. However, this project was also plagued by controversy. China Huadian Engineering Co. Ltd. had multiple disagreements with local communities about land acquisition.  In December 2013, February 2015, and apparently on other occasions, local residents blocked the entrance to the construction site, complaining that some of the land being used on the project had never been fully acquired by China Huadian Engineering Co. Ltd. and still belonged to them. Also, people displaced by the construction complained that they had not yet received title to the land that they were supposed to be given in compensation.   China Huadian Engineering Co. Ltd. was also criticized for failing to use local laborers — 90% of the construction workers on the site were apparently foreign workers and some of them were reportedly brought in without proper authorization.  In December 2012, immigration officials seized the passports of 75 illegal foreign workers at the site. In October 2012, members of the Buleleng Regency government threatened to shut down construction at the site until problems were resolved. In April 2013, legislators from the Buleleng Legislative Council visited the construction site and found numerous violations, including use of heavy machinery without safety certificates and use of subsidized fuel in construction."

The proceeds from the supplier credit were to be used by the borrower (PT Tanjung Kasam Power) to partially finance the $181 million cost of the EPC contract with China Huadian Engineering Co. Ltd. The borrowing terms of the supplier credit were as follows: a 10-year maturity and a 3 year grace period. The interest rate of the supplier credit is unknown. It is known that the borrower purchased credit insurance from Sinosure. China Huadian Engineering Co. Ltd., in turn, secured an export seller’s credit from China Eximbank in order to finance the supplier credit.   The purpose of the project was to install a 130-megawatt (MW) coal-fired power plant — with two 115MW generators (Unit 1 and Unit 2) — in Telaga Punggur subdistrict within Batam City, Riau Province, Sumatra Island (exact locational coordinates: 1.0441369, 104.1357136). China Huadian Engineering Co. Ltd was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. On August 31, 2010, a formal groundbreaking ceremony was held.  However, construction did not begin until March 1, 2011. The expected duration of the construction period was 28 months. However, the project was completed in 20 months (well ahead of schedule). In February 2013, the Jakarta Post reported that “[a]round 300 residents of Batam, Riau Islands, have rallied to shut down the Tanjung Kasam steam-powered electricity plant (PLTU) until state-owned electricity company PT PLN stops it from pouring ash onto their homes. The residents of Telaga Punggur subdistrict in Nongsa have complained of respiratory and skin ailments due to ash from the plant since the Tanjung Kasam PLTU started operations at the end of 2012." The residents were halted by local police as they approached plant managers on January 2, 2013 to demand the plant be shut down."

The study was completed by a joint venture of Fichtner and Norplan. Energy Infratech, a company based in India, served as the owner’s engineer for the project until September 2017. The consortium of Artelia Eau & Environment and KKATT Consult was appointed as the owner’s engineer in January 2018.  On November 26, 2014, the Government of Uganda and China Eximbank signed a preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC (2014) 33 TOTAL NO. (327) 14202014016565] worth $482,578,200 for the 183MW Isimba Hydropower Station and the Isimba-Bujagali Interconnection Project. Then, on March 12, 2015, the Parliament of Uganda ratified the loan agreement with the following terms: an annual interest rate of 2%, a default (penalty) interest rate of 0%, a 20-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, a 0.25% ($1,206,445.50) management fee, and a 0.25% commitment fee. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the cost of a $567,738,990.96 commercial contract [number MEMD/WRKS/2013-2014/00022/ERD] between Uganda’s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development and China International Water & Electric Corporation (CWE), which was signed on September 6, 2013 and amended on April 10, 2014 and May 20, 2014.   Under the terms of the PBC, the Government to Uganda was responsible for on-lending the full amount of the loan to Uganda Electricity Generation Company Limited (UEGCL) and the Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Limited (UETCL). The Government of Uganda provided a sovereign guarantee for the loan, and the Government of Uganda was obligated under the terms of the loan to open an escrow (or ‘repayment reserve’) account and deposit funds in the account to facilitate repayment and provide security (i.e. collateral) in the event of default. As of June 30, 2019, the cash balance of the escrow (repayment reserve) account was UGX 35,909,807,892 ($10,772,942.36).  The China Eximbank loan agreement also required that UETCL and UEGCL conclude a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) on a ‘take or pay’ basis for the project, and that UETCL and UEDCL and UMEME (or its successors or assignees) conclude a Power Sale Agreement on a ‘take or pay’ basis, in which UMEME or its successor is obligated to make deposits of revenues generated from the project into the escrow account. The loan agreement also specified that any shortfalls in collections and debt service would be met by the Government of Uganda. UMEME, which became the major privately-owned electricity distributor in Uganda in 2005 after winning a 20-year concession to operate UEDCL's main distribution network, was involved as a contractual signatory to the Isimba PPA in order to safeguard the repayment mechanism and avoid potential risks of revenues being misallocated. The fact that UEGCL was to supply UETCL all available power capacity on a ‘take or pay’ basis means that UETCL was to pay for all available electricity generated by the dam, and not only what was needed. However, in 2019, Uganda’s Auditor General discovered that the generation and sales licenses were in contradiction of the PPA and loan agreement because they stated that ‘the tariff methodology [will] be based on the energy service cost implying that the energy dispatch to UETCL will be influenced by market demand.’   According to the Government of Uganda’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), this loan achieved a 97% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 19 loan disbursements (worth $466,398,955.58) between 2015 and 2022: a $28,386,949.55 disbursement on August 14. 2015, a $72,126,626.59 disbursement on August 17, 2015, a $16,593,182.04 disbursement on November 19, 2015, a $70,494,066.49 disbursement on March 30, 2016, a $44,719,245.87 disbursement on November 8, 2016, a $8,903,102.70 disbursement on December 13, 2016, a $11,634,076.30 disbursement on April 18, 2017, a $9,797,214.32 disbursement on May 26, 2017, a $27,630,000 disbursement on August 8, 2017, a $40,394,439.87 disbursement on November 7, 2017, a $25,338,123.26 disbursement on March 30, 2018, a $9,149,993.75 disbursement on June 26, 2018, a $21,647,503.83 disbursement on November 16, 2018, a $13,983,133.08 disbursement on December 17, 2018, a $10,191,519.25 disbursement on April 4, 2019, a $12,490,242.92 disbursement on June 19, 2019, a $13,684,152.17 disbursement on November 8, 2019, a $2,942,702.21 disbursement on September 17, 2020, and a $26,292,681.38 disbursement on October 27, 2022. According to the Uganda Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development's Report on Public Debt, Grants, Guarantees and Other Financial Liabilities for Financial Year 2021/2022, total loan disbursements amounted to $440,106,274.20 and the loan’s amount outstanding (including arrears) was $391,848,454.20 as of December 31, 2021.   The project involved the construction of Isimba hydropower plant, which is located in the village of Isimba on the Victoria Nile, in Kamuli District. It is 4 km downstream of Simba Falls on the River Nile, approximately 50 km downstream of the source of the Nile. The project site is about 21 km from Kayunga Town as the nearest town and about 65 km from Jinja town. Its exact locational coordinates are: 00°46'18.0"N, 33°02'32.0"E (Latitude:0.771667; Longitude:33.042222). The project also supported the construction of a 132kv Isimba power substation, and the construction of a 41km, 132kv transmission line from Isimba to Bujagali. The Isimba power station will be installed with four vertical Kaplan turbine-generator units with a capacity of 45.8MW per unit, thereby providing a combined installed capacity of 183.2MW. The expected outputs from the 183MW Isimba hydropower station and the Isimba-Bujagali interconnection Project include (1) construction of the 183 MW Isimba hydropower plant, (2) construction of a 132kv Isimba power substation, and (3) construction of a 132kv Isimba-Bujagali double circuit steel tower power transmission line that is approximately 41 km in length. CWE was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. However, several subcontractors were also involved, including Artelia Eau & Environment, KKATT Consult, and Energy Infratech.   A technical feasibility study, as well as a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP), Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Social Impact Assessment (SIA) for the power plant and transmission line were completed between 2012 and 2014. An SIA undertaken for Isimba dam by the Government of Uganda (GoU) shows that public consultations concerning the project were held in the Kayunga, Kamuli, and Jinja Districts between October and December 2012. The same period is cited for consultations held in connection with the EIA. Field studies of flora and fauna were conducted in March 2013. The EIA was only finished in November 2014 and NEMA granted approval of it on May 19, 2015. The project’s certificate of approval was also issued by the National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA) to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development (MoEMD) in May 2015. A formal groundbreaking ceremony for the dam took place on October 5, 2013. However, project implementation did not commence until April 30, 2015. At that time construction was expected to be completed within 40 months (August 30, 2018). Construction ended in November 2018. Test flooding of the reservoir and the start of inundation of the Kalagala Falls Site (KFS) took place between November 2018 and February 2019. The power plant was officially commissioned on March 22, 2019. A series of ‘associated infrastructure works’ — including bridges and a connection road to Kamuli — took place after the commissioning of the power plant. The power plant was expected to generate 183.2 megawatts of electricity a year once it achieved a substantial completion mark on March 31, 2019. A takeover certificate was issued to the EPC contractor (CWE) on April 12, 2019, after the Government of Uganda and CWE agreed that all project defects were to be fixed by September 30, 2019. However, on September 16, 2019, local media reports indicated that CWE was stalling the completion of a bridge associated with the 183 MW Isimba dam project over a $42 million payment dispute with UEGCL. CWE alleged that UEGCL was unfairly withholding payment. UEGCL asserted that the payment was being withheld due to nearly 700 dam construction defects that CWE had failed to repair. In June 2021, during a UEGCL board of directors inspection of the project site, the Executive Director of UEGCL, Eng. Harrison Mutikanga, told the media that he was not happy with CWE’s performance because of delays and quality issues. He said that ‘[r]ight now, water is leaking in the concrete to the powerhouse, the contractor has not installed a floating boom, the generator circuit breaker has not been working for one month and because of that, [and] one of the turbine units is not working.’ He also said that ‘[t]he firefighting system automation is also not working, equipment frequently breaks down, the gate on one of the functioning units was designed to last for 10 years but only two years later, the paint is going off and the rubber that is supposed to control water is coming off.’ Without boom lines, Mutikanga explained that the dam risked being affected by the water hyacinth and floating islands, which could translate into national blackouts. Mutikanga also said the delayed completion of the project had led to government losses: ‘We want a plant that is generating electricity reliably, safely and to also make sure that all systems are working. We want all defects fixed with quality equipment so that we contribute to the government objective of social transformation.’ At the time, Mutikanga also denied allegations that UEGCL had not paid CWE: ‘We have paid them up to 93%. We have also started paying the interest on the loan to EXIM Bank (of China).’ UEGCL Board chairperson Eng. Proscovia Njuki added that: ‘[t]he contractor has not been fast as we thought. At first, they were delayed by COVID-19, but we are here to find out the challenges they are facing so that we address them. An agreement was reached to extend the defects liability period by one year to allow for proper completion of all the snags till March 2021, but with the defects we have extended the contract till March 2022. If by then we find out that some gaps are missing, we shall not issue a final certificate of completion.’ Then, on August 11, 2012, a group of engineers, supervisors, IT specialists, welders, and cleaners—worked frantically to restore power in one of the turbines at Isimba dam. The previous three days were reportedly ‘a nightmare’ after one of the workers opened a wrong gate during routine maintenance works on unit three—one of the four Kaplan axial flow turbines—and then the automated gate jammed, causing a flood that submerged four floors, including the powerhouse. Each of the turbine units has a generation capacity of 45.5 MW but only three had been active after the dam was officially commissioned on March 22, 2019. Uganda's Minister of Energy, Ruth Nankabirwa, and the Permanent Secretary of Uganda's Ministry of Energy, Irene Batebe, pitched camp at the project site. Ms Nankabirwa and her team were ushered into the control room. Across the choppy waters was a group of Australian dam engineers armed with monitors that fed footage to the CCTV room. The images gleaned by the divers were startling. Concrete under the water at the spillway gates continued to wash away and crumbling, among other things. The dam has four spillway gates. A spillway gate is raised and adjustable to allow the controlled release of water downstream whenever water levels in the reservoir—the large lake behind the dam—increase[s], including the probable maximum flood. The wearing of spillway waterway concrete requires a total overhaul. In June 30, 2022 correspondence with Irene Batebe, UEGCL chief executive officer, Harrison Mutikanga, flagged the crumbling waterway concrete, saying it was of ‘great risk to the overall stability of the dam with possible catastrophic consequences’ and that ‘UEGCL considers this risk to be of paramount importance as any delays to correct these failures only serves to increase the likelihood of these risks materialising and exposing government to great financial and reputational risk.’ As of August 2022, Isimba dam remained under the Defects Lability Period (DLP)— the time period specified in the contract during which the EPC contractor is legally required to return to a construction site to repair any defects. The DLP was set to expire in late 2022. CWE was reportedly reluctant to address the lingering defects until the summer of 2022. In September 2022, UEGCL employees warned of major safety issues and identified 10 ‘potentially catastrophic defects’ at the dam that, if it were to burst, could lead to massive flooding. The allegations of poor quality control on the part of the CWE are not new. In 2016, a legal claim was filed against the Isimba project in response to a leaked report that alleged that CWE was using substandard materials for construction of the dam."

The grant proceeds were drawn from an Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) that the Chinese Government and the Government of Moldova signed on December 15, 2011.   The purpose of this project is to construct a photovoltaic park with the installed capacity of 2.8 MW in Criuleni district. The project involves the construction of a photovoltaic power system and an electrical system, as well as a 10kV electricity distribution room and supporting facilities. Upon completion, the solar power station is expected to result in 2.86 million kWh of power connecting to the grid annually. It is also expected to be the largest solar power station in Moldova.    Sinohydro Bureau 9 Co., Ltd. is the contractor responsible for project implementation, and China Urban Construction Design and Research Institute Co., Ltd. (CUCD) are the contractors responsible for project management/supervision. A preliminary design scheme for the solar power plant was developed by the Chinese side and Moldovan side on December 30, 2016. Then, on January 2, 2019, a project implementation agreement was signed by representatives of Moldova's Ministry of Economy and Infrastructure, the Criuleni District Council, and the Agency for International Economic Cooperation (AIECO) within China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM). The MOFCOM grant fully disbursed on the same day. On May 5, 2019, Sinohydro Bureau 9 Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Power Construction Corporation of China, received a bid-winning notice from MOFCOM’s Bureau of International Cooperation Affairs of the Ministry of Commerce. As the general (EPC) contractor, Sinohydro Bureau 9 Co., Ltd. was made responsible for the survey and design, engineering construction, long-term quality assurance and supporting technical services after the completion of the project.  A groundbreaking ceremony took place on April 19, 2021. The project was originally scheduled to reach completion within 6 months (October 19, 2021). The power plant was successfully connected to the grid on November 25, 2021."

The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 20-year maturity, a 3.5-year grace period, and an annual interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 1.6% margin. The borrower was expected to repay the loan between December 2012 to June 2029. It was also expected to use the loan proceeds to finance 85% of the cost of a $970 million commercial (EPC) contract with China National Electric Equipment Corporation (CNEEC), which was signed in November 2008.   Sinosure and World Bank insured the buyer's credit loan (export credit facility) and the Government of Botswana’s Ministry of Finance also provided a sovereign guarantee. As an additional credit enhancement, the borrower agreed to maintain a minimum cash balance of $33 million (equivalent to one principal and interest repayment/installment) in a Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA). The Government of Republic of Botswana funded the DSRA with P300 million while Botswana Power Corporation paid the balance of P48 million.   The total cost of the Morupule B Power Project was $1.6623 billion. It was financed according to a 70:30 debt-to-equity ratio. ICBC contributed $825 million of debt financing, while the World Bank, and the African Development Bank contributed $136.4 million and $202.5 million of debt financing, respectively. The 30% equity contribution ($498.4 million) came from Botswana Power Corporation and the Government of Botswana.   In addition to the long-term (20-year) export credit facility, ICBC provided a short-term $140 million equity bridge loan to the project sponsor (BPC) to ensure that it could meet its equity contribution requirement. The borrowing terms that applied to the equity bridge loan are unknown. However, it is known that the loan was guaranteed by Standard Bank.  Standard Bank also provided 20-year currency and interest rate hedging for the export credit facility – a cross-currency swap designed to convert US dollar funding into fixed rate synthetic Botswana Pula, thus minimizing BPC's exposure to adverse movements in foreign exchange and interest rates, and enabling the sponsor to align loan currency with the currency of its revenue stream for the full repayment period.  The project involved the construction of a 600MW coal-fired power plant consisting of 4x150MW units — that uses circulating fluidized bed technology — for domestic power generation purpose. The 600MW Morupule B power plant is located in the township of Palapye, northeast of Gaborone, and it geographically adjacent to the existing 132MW Morupule A power plant. It sources feedstock from the same mine as the existing 132MW Morupule A plant. The project has three main components: the Morupule B Power Station; a 400kV Morupule B–Phokoje transmission system and associated sub-stations linking the plant to the BPC grid; and a 35-borehole well-field and associated water reticulation system. The coal is sourced from the Morupule coal mine, which is the only major operating coal mine in Botswana.  The Morupule coal mine is operated by Morupule Colliery Limited, a subsidiary of Debswana Diamond Company.   China National Electric Equipment Corporation (CNEEC) was the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation. Shenyang Blower Works (Group) Co., Ltd (SBW) also supported the project as a subcontractor.  Site and contractor’s camp accommodation facilities as well as bush clearing activities started in early June 2009 and were effectively completed by the end of July 2009, which facilitated CNEEC-SBW to undertake Topographical Survey and Geotechnical Investigation to confirm the design parameters associated with the in-situ ground geological data at the site area. The erection of the contractor’s camp facilities started in November 2009. The camp had the capacity to accommodate approximately 1,500 staff. The project's official EPC contract commencement date was April 29, 2009. However, the project's groundbreaking ceremony did not take place until February 19, 2010. It was originally envisaged that the power plant plant would become operational by October 2012. However, the project experienced significant delays and CNEEC did not hand over the four power generation units to the BPC until May 4, 2014. Then, in October 2014, three of the four power generation units broke down, and the Government of Botswana had needed to consider importing energy from South Africa. The power plant was originally expected to operate at the annual capacity factor of about 80 percent, with annual gross generation of about 4,200 gigawatt-hour (GWh). However, the plant’s capacity factor was closer to 50 percent, reflecting poor availability and unreliability of the units due to forced outages. Units 1-4 had the capacity to produce 600MW, but they only operated at 21 percent capacity producing only 130MW. According to BPC's 2019 Annual Report, BPC signed a Defects Remediation Agreement with CNEEC to remedy the plant's defects, which was expected to result in the remediation of all plant defects in a phased manner between 2019 and January 2023.   Efforts were also undertaken to expand the plant’s power generation capacity to 900MW after a tender for construction of two additional units (Unit 5 and 6) was awarded to a joint venture between Japanese Marubeni and South Korea’s Posco Energy."

The purpose of the project was to construct a 450MW hydroelectric power plant (hydropower station) — with four power generation units — in the middle reaches of the Konkoure River (approximately 6 km downstream of China Eximbank-financed 240MW Kaleta hydropower station). Upon completion, the plant was expected to achieve an average annual output of 2.016 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) and serve both domestic customers and several neighboring countries in West Africa (including Senegal, Mali, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea-Bissau through the West African power grid). The Souapiti hydropower station consists of a roller compacted concrete (RCC) gravity dam and a ground powerhouse equipped with four vertical-axis Francis turbine generators of 112.5 MW rated capacity each. Each turbine is designed to operate at a rated head of 87 meters. The RCC gravity dam is 120 meter-high and has a crest elevation of approximately 215.5 meters, while the dam axis length is approximately 1,164 meters. The normal storage capacity of the dam is approximately 6.3 billion cubic meters (bcm) and the design water storage level is 210 meters. The other mechanical component in the project includes 21 flat steel gates, 12 trash racks, two arc gates, six hydraulic hoists, two fixed hoists, one sewage gate crane, and a tailgate crane station. A double trolley 160/50 tonnes (t) bridge crane was utilized for the lifting and installation operations during the project construction. The electricity generated by the Souapiti hydropower station is fed into the grid through an 8.7 km, 225kV double-circuit power transmission line connecting the Kaleta (Kaileta) substation.   China International Water & Electric Corporation, a subsidiary of China Three Gorges Corporation (CTGC), was the general (EPC) contractor responsible for implementation.  However, many subcontractors were also involved. Harbin Electric Machinery Company manufactured and supplied the turbines and other hydroelectric units for the project. Sinohydro Bureau 3rd was subcontracted by CTCG for the civil engineering, grouting, electromechanical, and metal structures works in 2016, while Sailors Automation Technology Company was subcontracted for the supply of automation components in September 2018. Tractebel Engie was engaged to provide supervisory services for the project. It also assisted in the environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) as well as the resettlement action plan (RAP). Yellow River Engineering Consulting was subtracted by CWE for the design and engineering services of the project. Yingtai Group delivered nine 10kV voltage grade 1,600KW diesel generator sets for the project. Nodalis updated the feasibility study and evaluated the technical and economic viability of the hydropower project.   On December 24, 2015, a groundbreaking ceremony took place. However, main civil construction works did not commence until April 2016. The first and second power generation units achieved grid connection on November 8, 2020 and November 30, 2020, respectively. The third power generation unit achieved grid connection on January 5, 2021. The fourth power generation unit achieved grid connection on March 25, 2021. The power plant reached its commercial operation date (COD) on June 24, 2021. A final project completion certificate was issued in July 2022.   However, according to a Human Rights Watch (HRW) report published in April 2020, the Souapiti Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project has been plagued by a variety of social, environmental, and governance problems:  ‘[t]he dam’s reservoir will ultimately displace an estimated 16,000 people from 101 villages and hamlets. The Guinean government had moved 51 villages by the end of 2019 and said it planned to conduct the remaining resettlements within a year. Forced off their ancestral homes and farmlands, and with much of their land already, or soon to be flooded, displaced communities are struggling to feed their families, restore their livelihoods, and live with dignity. […] Residents displaced by the dam are resettled in concrete houses on land ceded by other villages. Residents have so far not obtained legal titles to their new land, creating a risk of future land conflicts between displaced families and host communities. Displacement is rupturing longstanding social and cultural links between families in the area. “In our culture, our social and familial bonds are essential,” said one displaced resident. “Extended families are being split apart. Whenever there is something to celebrate or mourn in the family, we feel the distance.”   Souapiti’s reservoir is also flooding a vast area of agricultural land, threatening communities’ means of subsistence. The dam’s reservoir will eventually flood 253 square kilometers of land, including an estimated 42 square kilometers of crops and more than 550,000 crop-bearing trees. A 2017 project document warned starkly that, “displaced populations will generally have less favorable land than they have been farming for generations.” Dozens of displaced residents told Human Rights Watch that they are already struggling to find adequate food for their families. “The people here are hungry, sometimes I don’t eat so my children can,” said a woman displaced from the village of Tahiré Center in 2019. Residents from several villages said that, whereas before being displaced they used to grow their own food, they must now find enough money to buy it from local markets. “With the fields gone, we’re slowly selling our cattle to make ends meet,” said a local herder and farmer. “We’re fragile like eggs because of the suffering here,” said a community leader relocated in 2019. “It’s only thanks to God that we survive.” Officials [from SOGES S.A.] acknowledged that displacement threatens communities’ livelihoods. “When you move a village, you’re breaking up the way they make a living, and you have to try to reestablish it,” said the [SOGES S.A.] head of environmental management and sustainable development. [SOGES S.A.] said it intends to restore communities to the same or improved standard of living that they enjoyed prior to the resettlement. SOGES S.A.] does not provide displaced residents with replacement farmland but said it will assist them to farm more intensively on their remaining land and find new income sources, such as fishing or cattle-raising. Displaced residents, however, have so far received no such assistance. “We’re not asking for something extraordinary. Prepare land for us to continue our activities, a pasture area for livestock farming. Respect the promises made,” said the president of Tahiré District, which encompasses several villages relocated in June 2019. International human rights standards require that resettled populations have immediate access to livelihood sources, and that resettlement sites should include access to employment options. The 2015 and 2017 action plans prepared to guide the resettlement recommended that [SOGES S.A.] begin work on livelihood restoration programs as soon as construction on the dam started in 2015.   At the end of 2019, however, [SOGES S.A.] had not started implementing livelihood restoration measures and displaced populations were receiving no support to help them reestablish the farming-dependent lifestyle they had left behind. [SOGES S.A.]told Human Rights Watch that it is, “in the process of redoubling its efforts to invest in the restoration of livelihoods in the coming month and for years to come.” [SOGES S.A.] pointed out that, in the short term, the government has provided food assistance – two deliveries of rice over six months and cash for basic essentials – to displaced families. “It helps people get on their feet,” said a [SOGES S.A.] official. But residents said that, given how long it would take to find new livelihoods, this was not enough. “We consumed what we were given in just over a month,” said a father of five who resettled in June 2019 from Warakhalandi. International standards recommend that displaced communities receive support until they return to the living standards they enjoyed prior to resettlement. [SOGES S.A.] also said that it compensates residents for the trees and crops growing on flooded land, although it has provided no payments to reflect the value of the land itself. Farmers have therefore received no compensation for land lying fallow as part of a crop rotation system, nor for land used for grazing animals.   A lack of transparency in the compensation process – with [SOGES S.A.] failing to adequately inform people about how compensation is calculated – has also fueled dissatisfaction with the payments made. Some residents said they have not been paid any compensation at all; others contend that, while they had been compensated for perennial crops, like fruit trees, they have received nothing for annual crops like rice or cassava. “The government gave us what they wanted. We accepted money without negotiation because we didn’t know the value of our resources,” said one village leader. Several women said that the bulk of compensation has been paid to men in family or community leadership roles, giving women little say over how money is used. Residents from all the villages Human Rights Watch visited said that they had complained to representatives of [SOGES S.A.] or to local government officials about the resettlement process, but that they had received either no response or one that did not address their concerns. “Someone says give [your complaint] to this person. They ask you to wait. He also has his director. Who are we supposed complain to?” said a community leader from Konkouré district. [SOGES S.A.] told Human Rights Watch that it had “delayed” in implementing a formal grievance policy, and only did so in September 2019, after more than fifty villages had been moved. [SOGES S.A.] did not explain the reason for the delay. As of December 2019, 110 complaints had been submitted to the new grievance mechanism. [SOGES S.A.] said that for future relocations is it negotiating agreements with communities that set out the Agency’s responsibilities during the process. While this could help clarify displaced residents’ rights, a sample agreement shared by [SOGES S.A.] contains only a single paragraph summary of the Agency’s obligations and offers no detail on how [SOGES S.A.] will address key issues like lack of agricultural land and support for livelihood assistance. [SOGES S.A.] should also ensure that residents have access to independent legal advice, of their choice, prior to signing agreements."

The PBC, which is captured via Project ID#53003, carries the following terms: 20 year maturity, 9 year grace period, 2% interest rate, and 0.3% management fee. The Government of Guinea used the proceeds from the PBC to on-lend to a project company and special purpose vehicle (SPV) called Société De Gestion de Kaléta (SOGEKA or 凯乐塔电站管理公司).   The borrower (SOGEKA) was to use the proceeds of the PBC to finance 75% of the cost of a $446 million commercial (EPC) contract between China International Water & Electric Corporation and the Government of Guinea, which was signed on August 15, 2011. As of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2020, SOGEKA’s outstanding repayment obligations under the China Eximbank PBC agreement amounted to $404.14 million. SOGEKA also signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) with the state-owned power utility, Electricité de Guinée (EDG), and agreed that once the Kaléta dam was operational, it would use the proceeds from the sale of electricity (generated by the dam) in order to facilitate the repayment of the China Eximbank loan. When SOGEKA was first established, the Government of Guinea held a 51% equity stake and China International Water & Electric Corporation held a 49% equity stake. However, on November 2, 2016, China Three Gorges Corporation purchased the Government of Guinea’s 51% equity stake for $200 million. The Government of Guinea used the $200 million to meet the requirement in a separate China Eximbank preferential buyer’s credit agreement (captured via Project ID#187) that covers 15% of the total cost ($1.383 billion) of the 450MW Souapiti Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project.   The Kaléta Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project involved the construction of a 240 MW dam that is located 110 km north of Conakry on the Konkouré River. The facility includes a roller-compacted concrete dam 72 feet in height by 5,069 feet in length. The dam impounds a reservoir that has 23 million cubic feet of storage capacity and the facility’s powerhouse has three 80-MW vertical axis Francis turbines. China International Water & Electric Corporation — a subsidiary of China Three Gorges Corporation — was the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor responsible for implementation. Construction began on April 18, 2012. Kaléta dam began to fill water in April 2015. The turbines began to run and distribute electricity ahead of schedule on May 29, 2015. The power plant was constructed according to Chinese technical specifications, and 90% of its electromechanical equipment came from China. The dam was officially put into use on September 29, 2015. Then, an official project completion ceremony took place on October 10, 2015. As of January 31, 2019, the Kaléta hydroelectric power plant had generated 2.708 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity. It reportedly doubled Guinea's electricity supply. Electricity subsidies from the Government of Guinea increased to 0.8% of GDP during the first half of 2019 when the country’s state-owned electricity company, the Public Utility Company (EDG), started to pay for the electricity generated by the  Kaléta Hydroelectric Power Plant in January 2019.   On January 22, 2015, the Government of Guinea also authorized the ratification of a USD $78,064,538.90 loan agreement with China Eximbank for the Conakry Electricity Network Rehabilitation and Extension Project. The borrowing terms of this loan, which are captured via Project ID#91941, are unknown.

The loan is payable over a 15-year period and it has a five-year drawdown period. Its estimated interest rate is 3.7149%. The Government of South Africa issued a sovereign guarantee in support of loan. By the end of 2022, the loan’s estimated disbursement rate was 83.62%.   The purpose of the project was to construction Medupi Power Plant (Medupi 发电厂项目) in Lephalale, Limpopo Province. The plant consists of six units (boilers) with a total capacity of 4800 MW. The project also involved the construction of the Ngwedi substation. The project’s total estimated cost is $11.31 billion.   Hitachi, Alstrom, and WSP Global were the contractors responsible for project implementation and management. The first structural concrete was poured on July 18, 2008. The Ngwedi substation transformer was officially commissioned in December 2016. By July 2017, Unit 1 was at full production capacity and Unit 2 was close to full capacity. In June 2019, Eskom reported that Unit 3 had reached full load on May 16, 2018 (796MW) and was first synchronized to the national grid on April 8, 2018. Unit 3 followed Units 6, 5 and 4, which have been commercially contributing electricity to the national grid since August 23, 2015 (U6), April 3, 2017 (U5) and November 28, 2017 (U4). The power plant achieved commercial operation status on July 31, 2021.  There are some indications that the CDB loan for the 4800MW Medupi Power Plant Project may have underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In February 2019, the CEO of Eskom was asked the following question by a reporter: 'Can you indicate and comment in general terms on the World Bank, DBSA, China Development Bank and other DFI loan covenants, and what may be considered a breach, such as failure to meet required going concern status, debt service coverage ratio and/or other metrics?' He responded that 'I am cautious not to breach the confidentiality of the lenders, but generally speaking, the going-concern status of Eskom is informed by normal credit metrics — interest cover, debt service cover, and so on. When we do find ourselves in a situation where we will not meet these requirements, many of the terms do allow us to put forward an action plan on how it’s going to be resolved.' Then, in February 2023, South Africa’s National Treasury announced that it would would take on ZAR 254 billion ($14 billion) of Eskom's ZAR 423 billion debt that was at risk of default, to enable the state-owned power utility to pay down its principal and interest obligations."

The foundation excavation work for the project began on April 23, 2012, and the power plant has been in commercial operation since February 2, 2016.   The World Bank's Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) agreed to provide $102.5 million in breach of contract insurance should Kenya Power and Lighting Company (KPLC) fail to honor its 20-year power purchase agreement with Triumph. MIGA's insurance also covers the Government of Kenya's obligations under the Government of Kenya (GoK) Letter of Support. According to Kwame Parker, East Africa Head of Debt Solutions & Infrastructure Finance at CfC Stanbic Bank, '[t]he highlight of this transaction is that it marks the first time that a Chinese commercial bank has used MIGA cover for a non-recourse transaction' and '[i]t's also likely the first time a Chinese financial institution is directly lending to a project company for a transaction in Sub-Saharan Africa that is not related to resource extraction, with no explicit sovereign guarantee.'"

Then, on October 11, 2009, Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) selected China Gezhouba Group Company Ltd (CGGC) as the project’s EPC contractor with a bidding amount of $89,231,692 (exclusive of VAT). A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) regarding the loan was signed by the Government of Nepal and the Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank) on November 4, 2009. The MOU referenced $200 million: $120 million for the 60 MW Upper Trishuli 3A Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project and $80 million for other projects. An environmental impact assessment (EIA) report was approved by the Government of Nepal’s Ministry of Environment on August 26, 2010 and forwarded to China Eximbank on August 31, 2010. Then, on February 28, 2011, the Government of Nepal and China Eximbank signed a government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2011) 9 TOTAL NO. (1399)] worth RMB 640 million (equivalent to approximately $90 million) for the 60 MW Upper Trishuli 3A Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project. The borrowing terms of the loan were as follows: a 1.75% interest rate, a 25-year maturity, and a 5-year grace period. The Government of Nepal used the proceeds of the loan to develop an on-lending arrangement (through a ‘Subsidiary Loan Agreement’) with NEA on April 15, 2011.   The loan agreement went into effect on June 1, 2011. However, the scope of the project was subsequently expanded and the face value of the loan was increased to $149,378,539. The loan achieved a disbursement rate of at least 66.3% ($99,047,167 out of $149,378,539), with 58 disbursements taking place between June 2011 and June 2021. The loan's amount outstanding was RMB 537,862,139 ($83,124,966) as of July 15, 2021. NEA (the ultimate borrower) was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance a commercial (EPC) contract that it signed with China Gezhouba Group Co. Ltd. (CGGC) on May 31, 2010.   The Upper Trishuli 3A hydroelectric power plant project involved the construction of a 60 MW run-of-river (ROR) plant with annual energy generation of 460 GWh. More specifically, it involved the installation of a 25 meter high diversion weir, intake, desander, 4.1 km headrace tunnel, surge shaft, inclined shaft, underground powerhouse, tailrace, switchyard, 48 km long 220 Kv transmission line, and a 4 circuit 1 km 220 Kv underground cabling and ancillary structure. The power plant is located near Simle village within Kispang Rural Municipality on the borders of the Rasuwa and Nuwakot districts. CGGC was the EPC contractor responsible for all civil, electro-mechanical, and hydro-mechanical works, including gradation of the 11.5 km long access road, construction of a steel bridge over Trishuli River, construction of temporary camp at headworks, and excavation of Adit no. 1 and head pond excavation. Northwest Engineering Corporation Limited (previously known as Northwest HydroConsulting Engineers) was selected as the contractor responsible for construction supervision. It was issued a supervision contract worth $4,443,926 on June 29, 2010. CGGC received a ‘Commencement of Work Order’ on June 1, 2011.   The project was initiated on November 23, 2011 and it encountered various delays due to disputes over whether to build powerhouse underground or overground, disputes about whether to increase the capacity of the project, damages to the access roads leading to the project site (resulting from landslides that were triggered by an April 2015 earthquake), and a blockade imposed by India. On May 26, 2019, the first unit of the plant was successfully connected to the grid. The second unit was successfully connected to the grid later in 2019. The hydroelectric power plant was officially completed and inaugurated on November 18, 2019. The electricity that is now generated by the plant mainly serves people in Kathmandu and it reportedly fulfills seven percent of the country’s total electricity demand."

The independent power plant project (IPP) was located at Thar Block II, 25 kilometers from the city of Islamkot, near the village of Singharo-Bitra in the district of Tharparkar within Sindh Province. Thar Block II was a 95.5 square kilometer area of the Thar coalfield, which has total lignite reserves of 175 billion tons which can be utilized to produce 100,000 MW for over 200 years. The project will be fueled by coal supplied by Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company (SECMC), which was developing a coal mine of 3.8 million tonnes per annum capacity beside the project (see Project ID#54315).   The total estimated cost of the 2 X 330 MW Engro Thar Block II Coal Power Project was $1.1 billion USD which was financed with 75% debt and 25% equity. Accordingly, the total equity requirement is $275 million. The majority of the equity investment for the project was expected to be from EPTL and its affiliates. IJGlobal reported that China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) invested $96.95 million USD (see Project ID#54316). In December 2014, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's (ICBC) Karachi Branch submitted an initial expression of interest to provide $825 million USD of debt financing for the power project. Then, a set of financing agreements were signed in Beijing on December 21, 2015 for both the power plant aspect (this project) and the mining aspect (see Project ID#54315). Under these agreements with EPTL, the 2 X 330 MW Engro Thar Block II Coal Power Project project was supported by a Pakistani rupee-denominated syndicated facility agreement from consortium of banks including: HBL, United Bank Limited, Bank Alfalah Limited, Askari Bank Limited, Soneri Bank Limited, Sindh Bank Limited, Bank of Punjab, MCB Bank Limited, Faysal Bank Limited, Pak Oman Investment Company Limited, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), National Bank of Pakistan, and Pak Brunei Investment Company Limited. The total syndicated loan is worth 17,016,000,000 Pakistan rupees.   Moreover, EPTL signed a bilateral facility agreement with National Bank of Pakistan worth 3,134,000,000 Pakistani rupees as well as Islamic facility agreements with three banks — Meezan Bank Limited, Faysal Bank Limited and Habib Bank Limited — worth 4,000,000,000 Pakistani rupees. All of these loans were repayable in 20 semi-annual installments commencing from the earlier of (i) first fixed date falling after 48 months since facility effective date and (ii) second fixed date falling after Commercial Operations Date (COD); where fixed dates are defined as first June or first December of any year and carries interest at the rate of 3 months KIBOR plus 3.5%.   On December 21, 2015, EPTL also signed a $621 million syndicated loan facility agreement with China Development Bank (CDB), China Construction Bank (CCB) and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC). The borrowing terms of the syndicated loan facility are as follows: a 14-year maturity, a 4-year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 4.2% margin, and a 7% Sinosure insurance premium. The Government of Pakistan also provided a sovereign guarantee. As of December 31, 2018, EPTL drew down $504,731 against this facility. China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. In April 2016, a groundbreaking ceremony was held. The project reached its commercial operation date (COD) on July 10, 2019.   However, this project has encountered a number of revenue generation, debt repayment, and financial management challenges since the power plant went into operation. In May 2022, reports emerged that the Government of Pakistan’s Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) had fallen behind on payments (for the purchase of electricity) to EPTL. Total payment arrears, at that time, amounted to PKR 45 billion (approximately $225 million). Several months later, on October 26, 2022, Sinosure informed the Government of Pakistan that it would not be able to provide credit insurance for any additional projects in Pakistan without ‘early resolution of [the] Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) pending between Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Chinese IPPs since 2017’. Under a November 8, 2014 CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement, the CPPA and Chinese IPPs had agreed on the establishment of an RAA to facilitate the automatic payment of at least 22% payables to IPPs directly through the recovery of electricity bills of distribution companies (so-called ‘discos’). However, ‘due to various technical and financial constraints’, the Government of Pakistan’s Power Division acknowledged that the RAA had not been implemented over the previous 5-year period. In May 2022, an effort to establish an RAA was undertaken by the Government of Pakistan, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.   Then, on October 31, 2022, Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance came up with an interim arrangement for the Power Division to open ‘an assignment under the title of Pakistan Energy Revolving Fund (PERF) till such time matters pertaining to RAA are resolved’. The escrow account was to be opened at the National Bank of Pakistan and operated by the CPPA and PKR 50 billion was to be allocated from the Ministry of Finance’s subsidy account to the PERF with a monthly withdrawal limit of PKR 4 billion (against invoices from IPPs). The Government of Pakistan acknowledged, at the time, that this '[would] not fully fulfill the revolving account requirements under the RAA, but it [would] provide additional comfort to Chinese IPPs’. Then, in November 2022, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet turned down a proposal by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) for the PERF (escrow) account to be operated by the National Bank of Pakistan. It decided that the account would instead be operated by the country’s central bank: the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). Then, in May 2023, EPTL informed the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) that it might shut down operations entirely because of a 'severe liquidity crunch' that made it challenging for EPTL to settle its liabilities with both lenders and suppliers. Its outstanding receivables from the CPPA amounted to PKR 65.5 billion at the time. EPTL demanded the CPPA pay it PKR 28.7 billion before May 31, 2023 to help it avert a default on debt servicing."

Its exact locational coordinates are 32.390278, 71.4625. The purpose of the China Eximbank-financed project was to construct a second unit (CNP-300 reactor) at the power plant (known as C2 or CHASNUPP-II) with nominal difference of generating a gross electrical capacity of 325 MWe with a net output of about 300 MW.   China Zhongyuan Engineering Company (CZEC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on April 8, 2005. The Chashma II power plant was officially inaugurated on May 10, 2011.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank government concessional loan for Unit 2 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.

35266,1648,"China Eximbank provides $448 million buyer’s credit loan for 969MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydroelectric Project (Linked to Project ID#54087)",2018,Pakistan,"On May 22, 2013, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a $448 million buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement [ID# CN-BCL-2013-01 and 2012211330] for the 969MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project (captured via Project ID#35266). The borrowing terms of the 2013 BCL were as follows: a 20 year maturity, a 8 year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.8% margin, a 0.75% management fee, and a 0.5% commitment fee. Then, on September 29, 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a second BCL agreement [ID# 2016211190] worth $576 million for the 969MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project (captured via Project ID#54087). The borrowing terms of the 2016 BCL were as follows: a 20 year maturity, a 8 year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.8% margin, a 0.75% management fee, and a 0.5% commitment fee. Both BCLs were to be repaid and secured with cash (from surcharges on electricity) deposited in an escrow account known as the Neelum-Jhelum Hydro Power Development Fund. As of December 28, 2018, the cash balance of the escrow account was approximately $10,760,508 (PKR 1.49 billion).  The Government of Pakistan on-lent the proceeds of the BCLs (at a 12% interest rate) to Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Company (Pvt) Ltd (NJHPC), which is a project company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) that was created to design, construct, own, operate and maintain the Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Project. As of June 30 2017, the $576 million BCL had fully disbursed and the $448 million BCL had achieved a 42.6% disbursement rate ($191.067 million out of $448 million).  According to a March 2018 tariff petition that NJHPC submitted to Pakistan’s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA), the total project cost of 506,579 million Pakistani rupees (PKR) was to be financed according to a debt-equity-grant ratio of 79:9:11. The total amount of debt financing amounted to PKR 401,416 million, which is roughly equivalent to $3.823 billion. Additional foreign sources of debt financing included $358 million from the Islamic Development Bank, $181 million from the Saudi Fund for Development, $81 million from the OPEC Fund for International Development, and $74 million from the Kuwait Fund for Arabic Economic Development.  The 969MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project is a run-of-the-river project in the State of Azad Jammu and Kashmir. The power plant has four power generation units and it was designed to divert the water from river Neelum through a tunnel. The tunnel intake is at Nauseri, 41 km northeast of Muzaffarabad and the underground powerhouse was constructed at Chatter Kalas, 22 km south of Muzaffarabad. The diverted water will produce electric power by passing through the turbines and thereafter this water will be released back into the River Jhelum, about 4 km south of ChatterKalas. Upon completion, the project was expected to produce 5.15 billion units of electricity annually.  The EPC contractor for this project was a Chinese consortium known as CGGC-CMEC that consisted of China Gezhouba Group Co., Ltd. (CGGC) and China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation (CMEC). In January 2008, a letter of commencement was issued to the EPC contractor. The implementation of the project began on February 9, 2008 and construction activities were originally expected to reach completion by October 2016. According to WAPDA, 90% of the construction works were completed by March 2018. The project was officially completed on April 13, 2018. The Neelum-Jhelum power plant delivered 590 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity from unit three on July 4, 2018, 453 GWh from unit four on October 4, 2018, 331 GWh from unit two on August 27, 2018 and 314 GWh from unit one on December 28, 2018. The project was originally expected to achieve its commercial operations date (COD) by December 2018. However, it is unclear if the project achieved this goal. As of February 2021, Pakistan’s Ministry of Water Resources had still not officially communicated the final COD to the Power Division. By April 11, 2019, the project had injected 2,400 GWh of energy into the national grid.  This project was plagued by controversy. In a performance audit of the project that Pakistan’s Auditor General (AG) submitted to the parliament in February 2019, the AG concluded that ‘NJHP is an exemplary mismanaged project resulting into heavy cost and time overrun.’ The audit reported an ‘unjustified abnormal cost overrun of [PKR 389 billion]’ and losses due to non-achievement of envisaged financial benefits of PKR 237 billion. It also reported losses of PKR 30 billion of revenue and an unjustified claim of PKR 175 million rock burst and an unjustified and uneconomical deployment of tunnel boring machine that failed to achieve envisaged benefits of PKR 23.15 billion. The audit also pointed to the irregular and unjustified award of construction of contract of PKR 90.90 billion before the appointment of consultants and non-obtaining of performance guarantees worth PKR 48.8 billion resulting into suspension of foreign loans and delay in the project. Also, the AG highlighted poor performance of consultants for the project engaged at the cost of PKR 16 billion and non-recovery of PKR 9.90 billion as liquidity damages from the contractors. Other problems identified by the audit include non-achievement of financial close till the project completion, delays in land acquisition, delays in adequate power supply, frequent major design changes, non-finalization of detailed engineering design, and frequent issuance of variation orders. Transparency International Pakistan also alleged that the procurement of tunnel-boring machines (TBM), which were meant to speed up the excavation of the remaining tunnels, resulted in $74 million in kickbacks.   Then, in November 2019, NJHPC CEO Mohammad Zareen testified before Pakistan's National Assembly Standing Committee on Planning and Development and noted that '[i]f revenue from the Central Power Purchase Agency (CPPA) does not commence by December 2019, the NJHPC/Wapda/GoP shall go into default due to back-to-back guarantee, apart from the NJHPC not meeting the routine maintenance expense.' Mohammad Zareen also testified that CGGC-CMEC abandoned the project after it had achieved a 99.6% completion rate and after shelling by the Indian Army at the dam site in July 2019 and October 2019. He said the Chinese contractor was not willing to return. Mohammad  Zareen said the company’s annual debt service liability amounted to Rs 50 billion and it was getting regular letters from the Economic Affairs Division (EAD) every month for the servicing of debt to external lenders. 'I will not have the funds to pay even for salaries after December [2019]', he said, adding that the Rs 100 billion raised from local banks was currently being utilized for debt servicing and salaries.  He also noted that Central Power Purchase Agency (CPPA) CPPA had not signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) with NJHPC: 'The PPA between the CPPA-G and the NJHPC, drafted and cleared by the legal section of the CPPA in June 2019, was submitted to the CPPA in July 2019 for approval of invoicing of payment of energy delivered, but is not being approved.' Consequently, NJHPC was not paid for energy delivered through the end of 2019. The non-signing of the PPA between the CPPA and NJHPC resulted in a circular debt build-up of about Rs 75 billion.  On July 4, 2022, when the power plant was running at its full capacity (969MW), an abnormal increase in water leakage was observed which was controlled through continuous drainage pumps and an investigation into the excessive leakage was started. On July 5, 2022, an emergency meeting was held between the project management and the project consultants team to analyze the situation and determine the root cause of excessive water leakage. It was observed that tailrace tunnel had obtained an abnormal pressure of 616m instead of the normal 600m. It was also pointed out by the project consultants that abnormal pressure of 616m in the TRT (tailrace tunnel) had been recorded which otherwise remained below 600 meter. Accordingly, to ascertain behaviour of TRT, one unit was shut down which resulted in decrease in pressure to 608m. The consultants recommended that TRT pressure should be below 604m. In this way, load was reduced gradually. Then, on July 6, 2022, it was determined that the abnormal increase in pressure and water leakages/seepage was due to blockage in TRT and considering the safety of the structure and all other equipment, the power house was shut down. Soon afterwards and after necessary preparation (lowering of bulkhead gates by Mobile Crane, functional check of dewatering pumps etc.), dewatering was started on July 10, 2022. After completion of dewatering up to the main collapse point (293m), an inspection of the tunnel was carried out. According to the findings of a report, 'It was found that tunnel is fully blocked in 42m portion (between 251m and 293m) besides other damages.' Upon submission of the report to the Prime Minister's Office, a meeting was held on July 13., 2022 in which the Prime Minister instructed the government to engage a foreign consulting firm for determine the causes of the defect and seek advice on the remedial works. A detailed ToR for consulting firms was issued by the Prime Minister's Office, which was later finalized by the inter-ministerial committee at a meeting held on July 26, 2022. Immediately after the incident, CGGC was engaged for carrying out repairs. The contractor started mobilization at the site and subsequently a contract agreement was signed with the firm on August 25, 2022. Work on the restoration of plant commenced shortly thereafter. However, in September 2022, Chinese engineers and staff reportedly abandoned the repair of the 969 MW Neelum-Jhelum hydropower facility, which faced issues related to substantial cracks in a tunnel, resulting in a shutdown of the power plant coinciding with a power crisis in the country.  The Chinese workers were reportedly facing security issues with local residents. The Government of Pakistan, at the time, rejected claims that work has stopped at the project site."

Then, on March 19, 2009, China Eximbank, HSBC, and BNP Paribas signed a $150.151 million syndicated buyer’s credit facility agreement with Northern Power Generation Company Ltd. (NPGCL) -- a Pakistani state-owned energy company -- for the 425MW Combined Cycle Power Plant Construction Project at Nandipur, Pakistan. China Eximbank contributed approximately $60 million through a USD-denominated tranche and a EUR-denominated tranche. The syndicated buyer’s credit facility had a 10-year maturity period but its interest rate and grace period are unknown. Pakistan's Ministry of Finance issued a sovereign guarantee on October 31, 2009 in support of the BCL. China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure) issued a credit insurance policy for the BCL on March 19, 2009.  The borrower was expected to use the loan (BCL) proceeds to partially finance an EPC contract between Northern Power Generation Company Limited (NPGCL) and Donggang Electric Corporation (DEC), which was signed on January 28, 2008.  The purpose of the project was to construct the 425MW Combined Cycle Power Plant at Nandipur, Nandipur near Gujranwala in the Punjab Province.   The general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation was Dongfang Electric Corporation Ltd. G.E. France served as a subcontractor. Construction began on October 16, 2008. The project's originally expected completion date was March 31, 2010. However, the project was plagued by delays and controversy. In January 2008, under a provision of the 18th amendment, the Government of Punjab, Pakistan signed a $329 million EPC contract with Dongfang Electric Corporation of China to construct the Nandipur Power Project and paid a 10% down payment. Then, a conflict between the Ministry of Water and Power and the Ministry of Law and Justice delayed the project execution for two years from March 2010 to March 2012.   The Ministry of Law and Justice raised an objection over a violation of Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) rules and the granting of the contract to China Dongfang Electric Corporation, which was blacklisted;  the ministry further refused to vet the permissions before issuing an explanation of procedures. As a result, machinery worth $85 million remained stuck at the Karachi Port for over two years. In September 2012, the president of Dongfang Electric Corporation, Zhang Guorong, terminated the contract for the construction of the Nandipur Power Project, saying his company had suffered losses worth $85 million.   In June 2013, Pakistan's Ministry of Water and Power started renegotiating the contract with Dongfang Electric Corporation to resume work on the Nandipur Power Project. After successful negotiations, the firm agreed to resume work on the power station. On July 8, 2013, engineers of Dongfang Electric Corporation arrived in Karachi to inspect the machinery lying at the Karachi Port and to secure its release. Later, work on the project was restarted at an escalated cost.   After several delays, the project was finally inaugurated by the Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif on May 31, 2014. However, the plant remained operational for only five days after the inauguration and had to be shut down due to mismanagement, conflicts with the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) over high production costs, and the use of inappropriate fuel. Since then, the plant has faced several controversies and operational failures, yielding inquiries and probes into misappropriations within the project. Ultimately, the energy produced by the Nandipur power plant was extremely expensive and the project was shut down after five days of operation."

The specific Chinese financier and borrowing terms are unknown. As of June 30, 2007, this loan was fully disbursed.   The purpose of this project was to construct an 18MW hydropower plant near the village of Naltar Pine in Gilgit−​Baltistan. A Chinese firm called CLIC (or Click) and Pakistan’s Ministry of Kashmir Affairs and Northern Areas (KANA) were jointly responsible for project implementation. A feasibility study was completed in 2000. The 18 MW hydropower plant was put into operation in October 2007.   Then, in February 2012, the Gilgit-Baltistan Legislative Assembly constituted a committee, headed by the provincial minister for power Wazir Shakeel, to investigate corruption charges in the 18 MW Naltar Hydropower Plant-IV Project. The committee was also given a mandate to investigate technical deficiencies in the design of the project, which apparently led to cracks in the reservoir. A group of engineers reported that aquatic worms or insects apparently ate the concrete, which led to the widening of cracks in the walls of the reservoir."

Ltd. (CPHGC) signed a $1,496,000,000 syndicated loan agreement with a consortium of Chinese state-owned banks — including China Development Bank (CDB, lead arranger), the Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank, co-lead arranger), the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), China Construction Bank Corporation (CCB), and Bank of Communications Co. Limited (BOCOM) — for the 2×660MW Imported Coal Based Independent Power Generation Project at Hub. According to CPHGC's upfront tariff application to Pakistan’s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority, the estimated borrowing terms of the syndicated loan are as follows: a maturity period of 14 years, a grace period of 4 years, and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus 450 basis points (4.5%). The borrower purchased buyer's credit insurance from Sinosure. As sources of collateral, the borrower also pledged shareholdings, assets, accounts, electricity payment receivables, and its Sinosure insurance policy.   CDB's contribution is captured via Project ID#52423. China Eximbank's contribution is captured via Project ID#92387. ICBC's contribution is captured via Project ID#92388. CCB's contribution is captured via Project ID#92390. BOCOM's contribution is captured via Project ID#92391.   The total cost of this independent power project (IPP) was $1.995 billion and it was financed according to a 75:25 debt-to-equity ratio. CPHGC is a project company and joint venture of China Power International Holding Ltd (CPIH) and the Hub Power Company Limited (HUBCO) that was established to finance, design, and implement this 1320 MW imported coal based power project. CPIH has a 74% ownership stake and HUBCO has a 26% ownership stake in CPHGC. CPHGC was granted a generation license by Pakistan’s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) on September 8, 2016. The term of the license is 30 years from the date of the commencement of commercial operations. CPHGC also submitted an application for an upfront tariff determination with NEPRA, which was approved on February 12, 2016. Then, on January 25, 2017, the Implementation Agreement (IA) and Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) were signed.   The purpose of the project is to construct 2×660 MW coal fired units and a dedicated jetty terminal to import coal at Hub, Mouza Kund, Tehsil Gadani, Lasbela District, and Balochistan Province. Northwest Electric Power Design Institute Co. Ltd. (NWEPDI) and Tianjin Electric Power Construction Company Limited are the EPC contractors responsible for project design and implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on March 21, 2017, and on April 10, 2018, CPHGC entered into Operation and Maintenance (O&M) contract with a consortium that consists of CEEC Tianjin (Pakistan) Electric Power Construction (Private) Limited, China Energy Engineering Group, Tianjin Electric Power Construction Company Limited, and China Energy Engineering Group Science and Technology Development Company Limited to provide operation and maintenance service for the coal-fired electric power generation plant. The project reached its commercial operation date (COD) on August 17, 2019. Its originally expected commercial operation date was August 31, 2018. It is expected that this power plant will provide 9 billion kWh electricity to Pakistan’s national grid each year, thereby meeting the electricity needs of 4 million Pakistani households.   However, this project has encountered a number of revenue generation, debt repayment, and financial management challenges since the power plant went into operation. The Government of Pakistan fell behind on payments (for the purchase of electricity) to CPHGC. Total payment arrears, as of May 2022, amounted to PKR 71.6 billion (approximately $379,480,000), which reportedly brought the power plant to the brink of closure and CPHGC to the brink of default. It also became more difficult for CPHGC to source the coal needed to power the plant (due to the inability of a supplier to provide coal from Afghanistan and skyrocketing international coal prices). Then, in July 2022, CPHGC) revealed that the country’s central bank — the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) — had stopped making various payments relating to coal suppliers due to the limited availability of foreign exchange in the country, which resulted in a major accumulation of payment arrears. In a letter dated July 20, 2022, the CEO of CPHGC, Ren Lihui, wrote to Pakistan’s Secretary of Power and warned that ‘any further delay in […] payments [from the State Bank of Pakistan] can adversely affect the ability of CPHGC to operate smoothly.’ He also warned that ‘If the Government of Pakistan fails to fulfill its responsibilities or does not respond in a timely manner, any loss, damages or [liquidated damages] should be borne by the Government of Pakistan.’   Several months later, on October 26, 2022, Sinosure informed the Government of Pakistan that it would not be able to provide credit insurance for any additional projects in Pakistan without ‘early resolution of [the] Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) pending between Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Chinese IPPs since 2017’. Under a November 8, 2014 CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement, the CPPA and Chinese IPPs had agreed on the establishment of an RAA to facilitate the automatic payment of at least 22% payables to IPPs directly through the recovery of electricity bills of distribution companies (so-called ‘discos’). However, ‘due to various technical and financial constraints’, the Government of Pakistan’s Power Division acknowledged that the RAA had not been implemented over the previous 5-year period. In May 2022, an effort to establish an RAA was undertaken by the Government of Pakistan, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.   Then, on October 31, 2022, Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance came up with an interim arrangement for the Power Division to open ‘an assignment under the title of Pakistan Energy Revolving Fund (PERF) till such time matters pertaining to RAA are resolved’. The escrow account was to be opened at the National Bank of Pakistan and operated by the CPPA and PKR 50 billion was to be allocated from the Ministry of Finance’s subsidy account to the PERF with a monthly withdrawal limit of PKR 4 billion (against invoices from IPPs). The Government of Pakistan acknowledged, at the time, that this “[would] not fully fulfill the revolving account requirements under the RAA, but it [would] provide additional comfort to Chinese IPPs’. Then, in November 2022, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet turned down a proposal by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) for the PERF (escrow) account to be operated by the National Bank of Pakistan. It decided that the account would instead be operated by the country’s central bank: the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). Then, in March 2023, CPHGC warned that it was at risk of defaulting on its loan repayment obligations due to overdue power purchase payments from the Central Power Purchasing Agency-Guaranteed (CPPA-G)."

(and its subsidiary in Hong Kong) was granted a Letter of Intention (LOI) by the Government of Pakistan, thereby officially obtaining the right to develop the Sahiwal 2 x 660 MW Coal-Fired Power Plant Project. One day later, on May 22, 2014, Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy Ltd. — a special purpose vehicle (project company) and joint venture of Huaneng Shandong Power Generation Co. Ltd. (51% ownership stake) and Shandong Ruyi Science & Technology Group (49% ownership stake) — was officially incorporated and established to assume responsibility for the development, investment, and management the two 660 MW coal-fired units in Sahiwal.  By July 23, 2014, a senior management team was in place at Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy Ltd. In November 2014, a project feasibility study report was approved after an assessment was made by experts from the Electric Power Planning & Engineering Institute (EPPEI) and the Government of Punjab. On November 21, 2014, SEPCO1 Electric Power Construction Corporation was selected as the EPC contractor through bidding.  Then, in February 2017, four Chinese state-owned commercial banks — the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), Bank of China (BOC), China Construction Bank (CCB), and Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) — signed a $1.44 billion syndicated buyer’s credit (facility) agreement with Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy Ltd. for the Sahiwal 2 x 660 MW Coal-Fired Power Plant Project. The estimated borrowing terms of the buyer’s credit are as follows: a 14-year maturity, a 4-year grace period, an all-in 4.95% interest rate (6-month LIBOR plus a 4.5% margin), and a 5.26% Sinosure insurance premium.

ABC's contribution is captured via Project ID#92304.  The total cost of the Sahiwal 2 x 660 MW Coal-Fired Power Plant Project was $1.808 billion. It was implemented as an Independent Power Project (IPP) — as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) Initiative — and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 75:25. Project ID #52659 captures the debt financing component and Project ID#54134 captures the equity financing component.  The purpose of the project was to construct 1320 MW coal-fired power plant — with two 660 MW supercritical coal-fired units (Unit 1 and Unit 2) — with synchronous installation of high-efficiency electrostatic precipitator and flue gas desulfurization facilities. The project site is located about 12 miles from Sahiwal and 9.3 miles from Okara cantonment, just north of the road which connects the two towns, in Pakistan's Punjab Province. Its exact locational coordinates are 30°42′55″N 73°14′20″E. The 690 hectare project site was given to the Chinese side by the Pakistani government free of charge. PowerChina Nuclear Engineering Company and SEPCO1 Electric Power Construction Corporation (a subsidiary of PowerChina) were the general EPC contractors responsible for implementation.  A groundbreaking ceremony was held on May 30, 2014. Foundation soil replacement and pile foundation tests commenced on February 6, 2015. Construction began on July 31, 2015. Unit 1 passed a 168-hour full-load trial operation and was put into operation on May 24. 2017. Unit 2 passed a 168-hour full-load trial operation and was put into operation on June 8. 2017. All network-related tests were completed on October 12, 2017. The project achieved its Commercial Operations Date (COD) and the power plant was connected to the national grid on October 28, 2017. As part of a build, operate, transfer (BOT) agreement, the power plant's ownership is to be transferred from the project company to the Government of Punjab after 30 years of operation.  However, this project has encountered a number of revenue generation, debt repayment, and financial management challenges since the power plant went into operation.

SEDL also entered into a 727,352,000 Pakistani rupee (PKR-denominated) loan facility agreement with ICBC-Pakistan (worth $7.134 million USD). The total cost of this independent power project (IPP) was $130.481 million and it was reportedly financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 80:20.   The $100 million (USD-denominated) loan agreement, which is captured via Project ID#52660, carried the following borrowing terms: a 12 year maturity, a 2 year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (1.4154%) plus a 3.75% margin, and a 6.552% Sinosure insurance premium. Arif Habib Corporation Limited issued a corporate guarantee in support of the loan. The loan was also secured (i.e. collateralized) against first charge of $107,134,400 (duly registered with Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan) over all present and future current and operating fixed assets of SEDL and a pledge of all shares in SEDL.   The 727,352,000 Pakistani rupee (PKR-denominated) loan agreement is captured in Project ID #72072. The borrowing terms are as follows: a 12 year maturity, a 2 year grace period, and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (1.4154%) plus a 3% margin.  Sachal Energy Development (Ptd) Limited is a project company (special purpose vehicle), 100% owned by Arif Habib Corporation Limited, and was established to finance, design, implement, and maintain the Sachal 49.5MW Wind Power Project. The purpose of this project is to utilize wind resources for electricity generation through the construction of a wind farm with a total capacity of 49.5 MW and to deliver the electricity generated from the project to the power purchaser, i.e. National Transmission & Dispatch Company Limited (NTDC). The project involved the installation of 33 Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs) from Goldwind. Each WTG had a capacity of 1.5 MW. Hydrochina Corporation was the offshore EPC contractor and Hydrochina International Engineering Company Ltd Pakistan was the onshore EPC contractor for the project.   Sachal Energy Development Pvt Ltd signed a power purchase agreement with National Electric Power Regulatory Authority in February 27, 2014, and the National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) agreed to purchase electricity at a tariff of USD 0.14861/kWh. The project's inauguration ceremony was held on April 20, 2015. Construction began on December 11, 2015. All WTGs were installed by December 20, 2016. The purchaser and seller Interconnection facilities were energized on March 6, 2017. The project ultimately achieved its commercial operation date (COD) on April 10, 2017.    Compared with the Dawood Wind Power Project, also a Chinese-financed 49.5 MW wind farm with a purchase tariff of USD 0.1187/kWh, the electricity from the Sachal Wind Farm is more expensive. It is expected that the project will provide power supply to the national grid of 136,500 MWh per annum. This wind power generation project site was developed on 275 hectares of land and it is located on Jhimpir within Thatta District and Sindh Province.

Then, on October 16, 2015, China Eximbank and Port Qasim Electric Power Company (Pvt.) Limited (PQEPCPL) signed a $1,598,380,000 term facility (loan) agreement for the Port Qasim 2x660MW Coal-Fired Power Project. The borrowing terms are as follows: 14-year maturity, 4-year grace rate, and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 3.70% margin. The Government of Pakistan provided a sovereign guarantee for the loan and a 27.2% guaranteed return on equity to the project sponsors (investors). Sinosure also provided credit insurance for the loan. These insurance fees amounted to 4% of total debt service (principal and amortized interest). As of October 2018, China Eximbank has reportedly disbursed $975 million through the loan.   PQEPCPL is a project company (special purpose vehicle) that was established in 2014 for the sole purpose of designing, financing, insuring, building, establishing, owning, operating, maintaining, and managing the Port Qasim 2x660MW Coal-Fired Power Project. The sponsors and shareholders of PQEPCPL are Sinohydro Resources Ltd. (51% ownership stake) and Al-Mirqab Capital (AMC) of Qatar (49% ownership stake). The total cost of this project was approximately $2.1 billion and it was financed with a debt-to-equity ratio of approximately 75:25. China Eximbank provided a $1,598,380,000 loan for the project, and the remainder was covered via $521 million of equity contributions from Sinohydro Resources Ltd. and AMC.   The Port Qasim 2x660MW Coal-Fired Power Project is located in the Port Qasim Industrial Park (exact locational coordinates: 24.7854°N 67.3695°E), and it consists of two modern supercritical coal-fired units, a self-dedicated coal unloading jetty and a 4 km-length channel dredged and transferred to Port Qasim Authority. The coal will be imported. The project, which is being implemented on build-own-operate (BOO) basis, is one of the largest “Priority Implementation Projects” under China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The EPC contractors are Sinohydro Harbour Co., Ltd and CCCC Second Harbor Consultants Co., Ltd. A groundbreaking ceremony for the project took place on April 20, 2015. Construction then began in May 2015. On November 29, 2017, Yao Jing, the Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan, accompanied the Prime Minister of Pakistan to the power generation ceremony of the first unit of the coal power plant at Port Qasim. Then, on April 24, 2018, the project reached its commercial operations date (COD).   This project has been plagued by controversy. Transparency International Pakistan alleged that PQEPCPL and NEPRA colluded to set a tariff for the coal-fired power plant and artificially inflated the cost of the project. In August 2019, Prime Minister Imran Khan directed the formation of a committee to examine the causes of the ‘high cost of electricity’ and circular debt, and to propose a way forward to ensure ‘the future energy security of the country.’ The committee was given 12 weeks to complete the onerous set of tasks, which it concluded in April 2020 in the form of a 296-page report, titled ‘Report on the Power Sector: Committee for Power Sector Audit, Circular Debt Resolution & Future Roadmap’. The report claims that the cost of the Port Qasim 2x660MW Coal-Fired Power Project was artificially inflated.   Then, in May 2022, it was revealed that PQEPCPL was having difficulty servicing its China Eximbank loan (including a $70 million principal payment due on May 31, 2022) due to the fact that the Government of Pakistan’s Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) had fallen behind on payments (for the purchase of electricity) to PQEPCPL. Total payment arrears, at that time, amounted to PKR 91.2 billion (approximately $483,360,000). PQEPCPL, in turn, had payment arrears to its coal supplier amounting to $140,000,000. As of May 2022, the coal supplier had stopped providing coal for the Port Qasim 2x660MW Coal-Fired Power Plant due to large outstanding payments. PQEPCPL warned that ‘without urgent payments to restore coal supply, the whole complex will shut down shortly’. Documents showed that the Port Qasim power plant also sustained losses of $153 million due to rupee devaluation. PQEPCPL official reportedly told the Pakistani authorities that ‘[s]ince 2014, billions of US dollars have been invested, thousands of people have worked hard for seven years but today the company has no cash, low coal inventory, huge outstanding payments, a huge exchange loss, making coal supplier and operation and maintenance contract bankrupt and facing loan default soon.’   Several months later, on October 26, 2022, Sinosure informed the Government of Pakistan that it would not be able to provide credit insurance for any additional projects in Pakistan without ‘early resolution of [the] Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) pending between Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Chinese IPPs since 2017’.

Ltd. (DPPL) signed a $78.82 million loan for the 49.5 MW Wind Farm Project. Based on DPPL’s tariff petition to Pakistan’s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA,) the estimated terms of the ICBC loan are as follows: an 11 year maturity, a 1 year grace period, and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (5.4%) plus a 3% margin (or 8.4%). On January 4, 2016, ICBC announced that it disbursed the first loan disbursement (worth $25 million) for this project. On April 22, 2015, President Xi visited Pakistan to witness the groundbreaking ceremony alongside Prime Minister Nawaz Shariff via video display.   Dawood Power (Pvt.) Ltd. (DPPL), the borrower of this loan, is a project company (special purpose vehicle) established to finance, design, and implement this 49.5 MW Wind Farm Project. HydroChina, a subsidiary of Chinese SOE PowerChina, has a 93.89% ownership stake in Dawood Power (Pvt.) Ltd. (DPPL). This independent power project (IPP) was financed with a debt-to-equity ratio of 70:30. It was implemented on a Build-Own-Operate (BOO) basis. DPPL signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with the Pakistan Power Grid Corporation that uses the “cost + return” method to price the electricity.   This project, which was designated as a priority infrastructure project for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), involved the installation of thirty three wind turbine generators (WTGs) from GoldWind, each of which generates 1.50 MW of power. The project site is located on 1,720 acres of tidal flats near near Port Qasim-Bhambore, Gharo Creek in Thatta District and Sindh Province. Northwest Institute of PowerChina — a subsidiary of the Power Construction Corporation of China — is the EPC general contractor, responsible for the project design, procurement and integration management of construction. The project was eventually put into commercial use on April 5, 2017 and it is currently operational. It reportedly provided 200 new jobs for local residents during its construction, and since completion, it is reportedly generating 130 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per year, which can meet 100,000 Pakistani homes’ needs and ease the country’s electricity shortages.   However, this project has also encountered a number of challenges since the power plant went into operation. As of May 2022, DPPL was seeking $13 million in compensation from the Pakistani authorities for the losses that it had sustained due to the transmission of electricity through a single transmission line. Its payment arrears reached PKR 2.7 billion ($13.5 million) in May 2022. Several months later, on October 26, 2022, Sinosure informed the Government of Pakistan that it would not be able to provide credit insurance for any additional projects in Pakistan without ‘early resolution of [the] Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) pending between Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Chinese IPPs since 2017’. Under a November 8, 2014 CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement, the CPPA and Chinese IPPs had agreed on the establishment of an RAA to facilitate the automatic payment of at least 22% payables to IPPs directly through the recovery of electricity bills of distribution companies (so-called ‘discos’). However, ‘due to various technical and financial constraints’, the Government of Pakistan’s Power Division acknowledged that the RAA had not been implemented over the previous 5-year period.

The 99 MW Jhimpir Wind Project was implemented as an independent power project (IPP) basis. It was reportedly financed with a debt-to-equity ratio of 75:25. Based on UEP Wind’s tariff application to Pakistan’s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA), the estimated terms of the CDB loan are as follows: 10 year maturity, 2 year grace period, and 5.45% interest rate.   The construction of the United Energy Pakistan (UEP) wind farm involved the installation of 66 wind turbine generators (WTGs), each of which generates 1.5 MW of electricity. The project also involved the construction of a 132KV substation and a control center. China Gezhouba Group Company Limited was the Engineering, Procurement, Construction (EPC) contractor for the project. Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology Co., Ltd, the largest manufacturer of wind turbines in China, supplied the WTGs. The project site is located at Jhimpir in Thatta district and Sindh province.

Under a November 8, 2014 CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement, the CPPA and Chinese IPPs had agreed on the establishment of an RAA to facilitate the automatic payment of at least 22% payables to IPPs directly through the recovery of electricity bills of distribution companies (so-called ‘discos’). However, ‘due to various technical and financial constraints’, the Government of Pakistan’s Power Division acknowledged that the RAA had not been implemented over the previous 5-year period. In May 2022, an effort to establish an RAA was undertaken by the Government of Pakistan, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.   Then, on October 31, 2022, Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance came up with an interim arrangement for the Power Division to open ‘an assignment under the title of Pakistan Energy Revolving Fund (PERF) till such time matters pertaining to RAA are resolved’. The escrow account was to be opened at the National Bank of Pakistan and operated by the CPPA and PKR 50 billion was to be allocated from the Ministry of Finance’s subsidy account to the PERF with a monthly withdrawal limit of PKR 4 billion (against invoices from IPPs). The Government of Pakistan acknowledged, at the time, that this “[would] not fully fulfill the revolving account requirements under the RAA, but it [would] provide additional comfort to Chinese IPPs’. Then, in November 2022, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet turned down a proposal by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) for the PERF (escrow) account to be operated by the National Bank of Pakistan. It decided that the account would instead be operated by the country’s central bank: the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP)."

PMLTC is a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and joint venture between China Chengxin International Ltd. (69.98% equity stake), China Excellence International Ltd. (30% equity stake), and the SPV’s directors (0.02% equity stake). It is responsible for constructing and operating an 878 km power transmission line from Matiari, Sindh (South of Pakistan) to Nankana Sahib, Lahore (North Punjab). The total cost of the 878 km Matiari-Lahore Transmission Line Project, which is part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and the Belt and Road Initiative, was $1,658,340,000. It was implemented as an Independent Power Project (IPP) — on a Build, Own, Operate and Transfer (‘BOOT’) basis — and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 80:20. The debt component is captured in Project ID#54013 and the equity component is captured in Project ID#53695.   On November 9, 2018, China Development Bank (CDB) Sichuan Branch signed a $1.326 billion overseas investment loan agreement with PMLTC for the 878 km Matiari-Lahore Transmission Line Project. The loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 10-year maturity length, a 2.25-year grace period (27 months), a 5.64% all-in interest rate (LIBOR plus 4.5% margin), a 1% upfront (management) fee, and a 0.2% commitment fee. Sinosure provided overseas investment insurance for this loan at a maximum rate of 0.60% per annum. The Government of Pakistan also issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan and a 17% guaranteed return on equity (ROE) to the investors in the BOOT project. State Grid International Engineering Ltd. — the overseas investment company of State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) — agreed to provide approximately $332 million in equity financing through two unspecified special purpose vehicles (SPVs). Financial close was achieved on February 27, 2019.   The purpose of the project was to construct an 878 km, 660 kV, High Voltage Direct Current Line (HVDC) that transmits 4,000MW of electricity (mainly from coal) from the Chinese bank-financed Thar Block-1 Integrated Coal Mine and Power Project (captured via Project ID#53674), the Thar Block-2 Coal Mine and Power Project (captured via Project ID#54314, #35127, and #54315) and the Chinese bank-financed Port Qasim Power Project (captured via Project ID#52904) to the northern parts of Pakistan (near Lahore). The starting point of the transmission line is at the Matiari Converter Station about 15 kilometers northeast of Matiari in Sindh Province, and the end point is at the Lahore Converter Station at a distance of about 40 kilometers southwest of Lahore in Punjab Province.  China Electric Power Equipment and Technology Co. Ltd. (CET) — a wholly owned subsidiary of State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) — is the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Under the terms of the BOOT contract, CET will operate the Matiari-Lahore transmission line for 25 years and transfer it afterwards to the National Transmission and Dispatch Company (NTDC), the Pakistani government-owned power transmission company. A project commencement ceremony took place on December 1, 2018. PMLTC also issued a notice to proceed (NTP) to CET for the commencement of EPC works on December 1, 2018. The project achieved mechanical completion in October 2020. It successfully completed equipment debugging, sub-system commissioning, and station commissioning with a certificate of readiness for interconnection and a certificate of readiness issued on December 1, 2020.   The project’s originally expected commercial operations date (COD) was March 1, 2021, but due to delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the project ultimately reached its COD on September 1, 2021. The transmission line is currently operational. However, various problems arose during project implementation. On November 30, 2020, NTDC and PMLTC acknowledged that there was a defect in the transmission line, which emerged during low power testing. Additionally, the certificate of readiness issued on December 01, 2020, was later declared null and void upon the failure of the low power test due to frequency oscillation on December 2, 2020, and a notice of dispute in the matter was served to the PMLTC by NTDC. The matter was resolved between the parties through Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) dated February 18, 2021 without a declaration of the force majeure events and both parties agreed to extend the COD until September 1, 2021.   The project has also encountered debt repayment and financial management challenges. In May 2022, reports emerged that the Government of Pakistan’s Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) had fallen behind on payments (for the purchase of electricity) to PMLTC. Total payment arrears, at that time, amounted to PKR 14.5 billion (approximately $72.5 million). Then, in June 2022, the Private Power & Infrastructure Board (PPIB) requested that the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) make available foreign exchange so that PMLTC could make a $6.31 million Sinosure fee payment. In a letter to SBP’s Executive Director ofFinancial Market and Reserve Management (dated June 24, 2022), PMLTC noted a significant delay in approval by SBP of the $6.31 million payment request filed by the company on May 9, 2022. It also noted that late payment could result in a material breach of Sinosure policy leading to a contractual breach under financing documents. PPIB also noted that non-availability of requisite foreign currency could result in the lapse of consent under the Implementation Agreement (IA), which could in turn expose the Government of Pakistan to litigation. According to PPIB, pursuant to provisions of the IA, it is the responsibility of Government of Pakistan to make available through SBP the foreign currency not available through normal banking channels within the specified time for payment in foreign currency related to the projects, including the payment of premiums and fees to offshore insurers and reinsurers.   Then, in July 2022, Zhang Li (CEO of PMLTC) wrote a letter to the Managing Director of the PPIB, warning that the Government of Pakistan’s imposition of 17 percent general sales tax (GST) on transmission service charges (through amendments to the Finance Act, 2022 and Sales Tax Act, 1990) would have ‘severe financial implications’ for PMLTC. Several months later, on October 26, 2022, Sinosure informed the Government of Pakistan that it would not be able to provide credit insurance for any additional projects in Pakistan without ‘early resolution of [the] Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) pending between Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Chinese IPPs since 2017’.

54087,1648,"China Eximbank provides $576 million buyer's credit loan for 969MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydroelectric Project (Linked to Project ID#35266)",2018,Pakistan,"On May 22, 2013, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a $448 million buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement [ID# CN-BCL-2013-01 and 2012211330] for the 969MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project (captured via Project ID#35266). The borrowing terms of the 2013 BCL were as follows: a 20 year maturity, a 8 year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.8% margin, a 0.75% management fee, and a 0.5% commitment fee. Then, on September 29, 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a second BCL agreement [ID# 2016211190] worth $576 million for the 969MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project (captured via Project ID#54087). The borrowing terms of the 2016 BCL were as follows: a 20 year maturity, a 8 year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.8% margin, a 0.75% management fee, and a 0.5% commitment fee. Both BCLs were to be repaid and secured with cash (from surcharges on electricity) deposited in an escrow account known as the Neelum-Jhelum Hydro Power Development Fund. As of December 28, 2018, the cash balance of the escrow account was approximately $10,760,508 (PKR 1.49 billion).  The Government of Pakistan on-lent the proceeds of the BCLs (at a 12% interest rate) to Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Company (Pvt) Ltd (NJHPC), which is a project company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) that was created to design, construct, own, operate and maintain the Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Project. As of June 30 2017, the $576 million BCL had fully disbursed and the $448 million BCL had achieved a 42.6% disbursement rate ($191.067 million out of $448 million).  According to a March 2018 tariff petition that NJHPC submitted to Pakistan’s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA), the total project cost of 506,579 million Pakistani rupees (PKR) was to be financed according to a debt-equity-grant ratio of 79:9:11. The total amount of debt financing amounted to PKR 401,416 million, which is roughly equivalent to $3.823 billion. Additional foreign sources of debt financing included $358 million from the Islamic Development Bank, $181 million from the Saudi Fund for Development, $81 million from the OPEC Fund for International Development, and $74 million from the Kuwait Fund for Arabic Economic Development.  The 969MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project is a run-of-the-river project in the State of Azad Jammu and Kashmir. The power plant has four power generation units and it was designed to divert the water from river Neelum through a tunnel. The tunnel intake is at Nauseri, 41 km northeast of Muzaffarabad and the underground powerhouse was constructed at Chatter Kalas, 22 km south of Muzaffarabad. The diverted water will produce electric power by passing through the turbines and thereafter this water will be released back into the River Jhelum, about 4 km south of ChatterKalas. Upon completion, the project was expected to produce 5.15 billion units of electricity annually.  The EPC contractor for this project was a Chinese consortium known as CGGC-CMEC that consisted of China Gezhouba Group Co., Ltd. (CGGC) and China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation (CMEC). In January 2008, a letter of commencement was issued to the EPC contractor. The implementation of the project began on February 9, 2008 and construction activities were originally expected to reach completion by October 2016. According to WAPDA, 90% of the construction works were completed by March 2018. The project was officially completed on April 13, 2018. The Neelum-Jhelum power plant delivered 590 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity from unit three on July 4, 2018, 453 GWh from unit four on October 4, 2018, 331 GWh from unit two on August 27, 2018 and 314 GWh from unit one on December 28, 2018. The project was originally expected to achieve its commercial operations date (COD) by December 2018. However, it is unclear if the project achieved this goal. As of February 2021, Pakistan’s Ministry of Water Resources had still not officially communicated the final COD to the Power Division. By April 11, 2019, the project had injected 2,400 GWh of energy into the national grid.  This project was plagued by controversy. In a performance audit of the project that Pakistan’s Auditor General (AG) submitted to the parliament in February 2019, the AG concluded that ‘NJHP is an exemplary mismanaged project resulting into heavy cost and time overrun.’ The audit reported an ‘unjustified abnormal cost overrun of [PKR 389 billion]’ and losses due to non-achievement of envisaged financial benefits of PKR 237 billion. It also reported losses of PKR 30 billion of revenue and an unjustified claim of PKR 175 million rock burst and an unjustified and uneconomical deployment of tunnel boring machine that failed to achieve envisaged benefits of PKR 23.15 billion. The audit also pointed to the irregular and unjustified award of construction of contract of PKR 90.90 billion before the appointment of consultants and non-obtaining of performance guarantees worth PKR 48.8 billion resulting into suspension of foreign loans and delay in the project. Also, the AG highlighted poor performance of consultants for the project engaged at the cost of PKR 16 billion and non-recovery of PKR 9.90 billion as liquidity damages from the contractors. Other problems identified by the audit include non-achievement of financial close till the project completion, delays in land acquisition, delays in adequate power supply, frequent major design changes, non-finalization of detailed engineering design, and frequent issuance of variation orders. Transparency International Pakistan also alleged that the procurement of tunnel-boring machines (TBM), which were meant to speed up the excavation of the remaining tunnels, resulted in $74 million in kickbacks.   On July 4, 2022, when the power plant was running at its full capacity (969MW), an abnormal increase in water leakage was observed which was controlled through continuous drainage pumps and an investigation into the excessive leakage was started. On July 5, 2022, an emergency meeting was held between the project management and the project consultants team to analyze the situation and determine the root cause of excessive water leakage. It was observed that tailrace tunnel had obtained an abnormal pressure of 616m instead of the normal 600m. It was also pointed out by the project consultants that abnormal pressure of 616m in the TRT (tailrace tunnel) had been recorded which otherwise remained below 600 meter. Accordingly, to ascertain behaviour of TRT, one unit was shut down which resulted in decrease in pressure to 608m. The consultants recommended that TRT pressure should be below 604m. In this way, load was reduced gradually. Then, on July 6, 2022, it was determined that the abnormal increase in pressure and water leakages/seepage was due to blockage in TRT and considering the safety of the structure and all other equipment, the power house was shut down. Soon afterwards and after necessary preparation (lowering of bulkhead gates by Mobile Crane, functional check of dewatering pumps etc.), dewatering was started on July 10, 2022. After completion of dewatering up to the main collapse point (293m), an inspection of the tunnel was carried out. According to the findings of a report, 'It was found that tunnel is fully blocked in 42m portion (between 251m and 293m) besides other damages.' Upon submission of the report to the Prime Minister's Office, a meeting was held on July 13., 2022 in which the Prime Minister instructed the government to engage a foreign consulting firm for determine the causes of the defect and seek advice on the remedial works. A detailed ToR for consulting firms was issued by the Prime Minister's Office, which was later finalized by the inter-ministerial committee at a meeting held on July 26, 2022. Immediately after the incident, CGGC was engaged for carrying out repairs. The contractor started mobilization at the site and subsequently a contract agreement was signed with the firm on August 25, 2022. Work on the restoration of plant commenced shortly thereafter. However, in September 2022, Chinese engineers and staff reportedly abandoned the repair of the 969 MW Neelum-Jhelum hydropower facility, which faced issues related to substantial cracks in a tunnel, resulting in a shutdown of the power plant coinciding with a power crisis in the country.  The Chinese workers were reportedly facing security issues with local residents. The Government of Pakistan, at the time, rejected claims that work has stopped at the project site.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank buyer’s credit loan for the 969MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydroelectric Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In November 2019, NJHPC CEO Mohammad Zareen testified before Pakistan's National Assembly Standing Committee on Planning and Development and noted that '[i]f revenue from the Central Power Purchase Agency (CPPA) does not commence by December 2019, the NJHPC/Wapda/GoP shall go into default due to back-to-back guarantee, apart from the NJHPC not meeting the routine maintenance expense.' Mohammad Zareen also testified that CGGC-CMEC abandoned the project after it had achieved a 99.6% completion rate and after shelling by the Indian Army at the dam site in July 2019 and October 2019. He said the Chinese contractor was not willing to return. Mohammad  Zareen said the company’s annual debt service liability amounted to Rs 50 billion and it was getting regular letters from the Economic Affairs Division (EAD) every month for the servicing of debt to external lenders. 'I will not have the funds to pay even for salaries after December [2019]', he said, adding that the Rs 100 billion raised from local banks was currently being utilized for debt servicing and salaries.  He also noted that Central Power Purchase Agency (CPPA) CPPA had not signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) with NJHPC: 'The PPA between the CPPA-G and the NJHPC, drafted and cleared by the legal section of the CPPA in June 2019, was submitted to the CPPA in July 2019 for approval of invoicing of payment of energy delivered, but is not being approved.' Consequently, NJHPC was not paid for energy delivered through the end of 2019. The non-signing of the PPA between the CPPA and NJHPC resulted in a circular debt build-up of about Rs 75 billion. Then, on or around July 1, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under the buyer’s credit loan agreement for the 969MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydroelectric Project. Then, on November 19, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed another debt suspension agreement [No. DSSI2021PHASE1-036]. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between January 1, 2021 and June 30, 2021 under the buyer’s credit loan agreement for the 969MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydroelectric Project. Then, on or around July 1, 2021, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed another debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021 under the buyer’s credit loan agreement for the 969MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydroelectric Project. The debt service suspension (rescheduling) from July 2020-December 2020 is captured via Project ID#96254. The debt service suspension (rescheduling) from January 2021-June 2021 is captured via Project ID#96251.

Bank of Jiangsu Co. Ltd. provided the third loan worth $64.440 million with a 5.0958% interest rate and a 10-year maturity (captured via Project ID#54286). The borrower purchased credit insurance from Sinosure for both of these loans. The borrower, BGEPL, was expected to use the loan proceeds to partially finance two commercial (EPC) contracts that it signed on June 27, 2015: an offshore supply contract that it signed with China First Metallurgical Group Co. Ltd. and an onshore construction contract that it signed with MCC Ruba International Construction Company (Pvt) Ltd. The $150.269 million project was implemented on a build, own and operate (BOO) basis and financed according to a debt-equity ratio of 81:19. BGEPL achieved financial close on December 28, 2015, which is typically the date of the first loan disbursement.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 100 MW Solar PV Power Plant located in Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park at Lal Sohanra in Cholistan, within Bahawalpur District in the Province of Punjab. China First Metallurgical Group Co. Ltd and MCC Ruba International Construction Company (Pvt) Ltd were the EPC contractors responsible for project implementation. The project reached its commercial operations date (COD) on July 31, 2016.   However, this project has encountered debt repayment and financial management challenges since the power plant went into operation. In May 2022, reports emerged that the Government of Pakistan’s Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) had fallen behind on payments (for the purchase of electricity) to Zonergy and its subsidiaries/SPVs. Total payment arrears, at that time, amounted to PKR 10.4 billion (approximately $52 million). Several months later, on October 26, 2022, Sinosure informed the Government of Pakistan that it would not be able to provide credit insurance for any additional projects in Pakistan without ‘early resolution of [the] Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) pending between Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Chinese IPPs since 2017’. Under a November 8, 2014 CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement, the CPPA and Chinese IPPs had agreed on the establishment of an RAA to facilitate the automatic payment of at least 22% payables to IPPs directly through the recovery of electricity bills of distribution companies (so-called ‘discos’). However, ‘due to various technical and financial constraints’, the Government of Pakistan’s Power Division acknowledged that the RAA had not been implemented over the previous 5-year period. In May 2022, an effort to establish an RAA was undertaken by the Government of Pakistan, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.   Then, on October 31, 2022, Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance came up with an interim arrangement for the Power Division to open ‘an assignment under the title of Pakistan Energy Revolving Fund (PERF) till such time matters pertaining to RAA are resolved’. The escrow account was to be opened at the National Bank of Pakistan and operated by the CPPA and PKR 50 billion was to be allocated from the Ministry of Finance’s subsidy account to the PERF with a monthly withdrawal limit of PKR 4 billion (against invoices from IPPs). The Government of Pakistan acknowledged, at the time, that this “[would] not fully fulfill the revolving account requirements under the RAA, but it [would] provide additional comfort to Chinese IPPs’. Then, in November 2022, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet turned down a proposal by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) for the PERF (escrow) account to be operated by the National Bank of Pakistan.

The first was a $100 million USD-denominated loan facility agreement (see Project ID #52660) with a 12 year maturity, 2 year grace period and an interest rate of 6 month LIBOR (1.4154%) plus a 3.75% margin. Sinosure provided insurance for this USD-denominated component. The second loan was a PKR-denominated facility worth PKR 727,352,000 (captured in this project) with a 12 year maturity, 2 year grace period, and an interest rate of 6 month LIBOR (1.4154%) plus a 3% margin.   The total cost of this independent power project (IPP) was $130.481 million and it was reportedly financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 80:20.   Sachal Energy Development (Ptd) Limited (SEDL) is a project company (special purpose vehicle) is 100% owned by Arif Habib Corporation Limited and it was established to finance, design, implement, and maintain the Sachal 49.5MW Wind Power Project. The purpose of this project is to utilize wind resources for electricity generation through the construction of a wind farm with a total capacity of 49.5 MW and to deliver the electricity generated from the project to the power purchaser, i.e. National Transmission & Dispatch Company Limited (NTDC). The project involved the installation of 33 Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs) from Goldwind. Each WTG had a capacity of 1.5 MW. Hydrochina Corporation was the offshore EPC contractor and Hydrochina International Engineering Company Ltd Pakistan was the onshore EPC contractor for the project.   Sachal Energy Development Pvt Ltd signed a power purchase agreement with National Electric Power Regulatory Authority in February 27, 2014, and the National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) agreed to purchase electricity at a tariff of USD 0.14861/kWh. The project's inauguration ceremony was held on April 20, 2015. Construction began on December 11, 2015. All WTGs were installed by December 20, 2016. The purchaser and seller Interconnection facilities were energized on March 6, 2017. The project ultimately achieved its commercial operation date (COD) on April 10, 2017.   Compared with the Dawood Wind Power Project, also a Chinese-financed 49.5 MW wind farm with a purchase tariff of USD 0.1187/kWh, the electricity from the Sachal Wind Farm is more expensive. It is expected that the project will provide power supply to the national grid of 136,500 MWh per annum. This wind power generation project site was developed on 275 hectares of land and it is located on Jhimpir within Thatta District and Sindh Province."

Project ID #52659 captures the debt financing component and Project ID#54134 captures the equity financing component.  The purpose of the project was to construct 1320 MW coal-fired power plant — with two 660 MW supercritical coal-fired units (Unit 1 and Unit 2) — with synchronous installation of high-efficiency electrostatic precipitator and flue gas desulfurization facilities. The project site is located about 12 miles from Sahiwal and 9.3 miles from Okara cantonment, just north of the road which connects the two towns, in Pakistan's Punjab Province.

In April 2018, reports emerged that the Government of Pakistan’s Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) had fallen behind on payments (for the purchase of electricity) to Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy Ltd. Total payment arrears, at that time, amounted to PKR 20 billion (approximately $172 million), which reportedly brought the Sahiwal 2 x 660 MW Coal-Fired Power Plant Project to ‘to the brink of closure’. It also made it more difficult for Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy Ltd. to source the coal needed to power the plant (since Pakistan Railway demands advance payment for coal transportation). Then, in a letter dated August 7, 2022, Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy Ltd. acknowledged that more than 0.5 million tons of South African coal were being stored in Port Qasim and awaiting clearance because it was unable to pay the coal supplier.   Several months later, on October 26, 2022, Sinosure informed the Government of Pakistan that it would not be able to provide credit insurance for any additional projects in Pakistan without ‘early resolution of [the] Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) pending between Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Chinese IPPs since 2017’.

However, ‘due to various technical and financial constraints’, the Government of Pakistan’s Power Division acknowledged that the RAA had not been implemented over the previous 5-year period. In May 2022, an effort to establish an RAA was undertaken by the Government of Pakistan, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.   Then, on October 31, 2022, Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance came up with an interim arrangement for the Power Division to open ‘an assignment under the title of Pakistan Energy Revolving Fund (PERF) till such time matters pertaining to RAA are resolved’. The escrow account was to be opened at the National Bank of Pakistan and operated by the CPPA and PKR 50 billion was to be allocated from the Ministry of Finance’s subsidy account to the PERF with a monthly withdrawal limit of PKR 4 billion (against invoices from IPPs). The Government of Pakistan acknowledged, at the time, that this “[would] not fully fulfill the revolving account requirements under the RAA, but it [would] provide additional comfort to Chinese IPPs’.

A groundbreaking ceremony took place on March 21, 2017, and on April 10, 2018, CPHGC entered into Operation and Maintenance (O&M) contract with a consortium that consists of CEEC Tianjin (Pakistan) Electric Power Construction (Private) Limited, China Energy Engineering Group, Tianjin Electric Power Construction Company Limited, and China Energy Engineering Group Science and Technology Development Company Limited to provide operation and maintenance service for the coal-fired electric power generation plant. The project reached its commercial operation date (COD) on August 17, 2019. Its originally expected commercial operation date was August 31, 2018. It is expected that this power plant will provide 9 billion kWh electricity to Pakistan’s national grid each year, thereby meeting the electricity needs of 4 million Pakistani households.   However, this project has encountered a number of revenue generation, debt repayment, and financial management challenges since the power plant went into operation. The Government of Pakistan fell behind on payments (for the purchase of electricity) to CPHGC. Total payment arrears, as of May 2022, amounted to PKR 71.6 billion (approximately $379,480,000), which reportedly brought the power plant to the brink of closure and CPHGC to the brink of default. It also became more difficult for CPHGC to source the coal needed to power the plant (due to the inability of a supplier to provide coal from Afghanistan and skyrocketing international coal prices). Then, in July 2022, CPHGC) revealed that the country’s central bank — the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) — had stopped making various payments relating to coal suppliers due to the limited availability of foreign exchange in the country, which resulted in a major accumulation of payment arrears. In a letter dated July 20, 2022, the CEO of CPHGC, Ren Lihui, wrote to Pakistan’s Secretary of Power and warned that ‘any further delay in […] payments [from the State Bank of Pakistan] can adversely affect the ability of CPHGC to operate smoothly.’ He also warned that ‘If the Government of Pakistan fails to fulfill its responsibilities or does not respond in a timely manner, any loss, damages or [liquidated damages] should be borne by the Government of Pakistan.’   Several months later, on October 26, 2022, Sinosure informed the Government of Pakistan that it would not be able to provide credit insurance for any additional projects in Pakistan without ‘early resolution of [the] Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) pending between Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Chinese IPPs since 2017’. Under a November 8, 2014 CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement, the CPPA and Chinese IPPs had agreed on the establishment of an RAA to facilitate the automatic payment of at least 22% payables to IPPs directly through the recovery of electricity bills of distribution companies (so-called ‘discos’). However, ‘due to various technical and financial constraints’, the Government of Pakistan’s Power Division acknowledged that the RAA had not been implemented over the previous 5-year period. In May 2022, an effort to establish an RAA was undertaken by the Government of Pakistan, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.   Then, on October 31, 2022, Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance came up with an interim arrangement for the Power Division to open ‘an assignment under the title of Pakistan Energy Revolving Fund (PERF) till such time matters pertaining to RAA are resolved’. The escrow account was to be opened at the National Bank of Pakistan and operated by the CPPA and PKR 50 billion was to be allocated from the Ministry of Finance’s subsidy account to the PERF with a monthly withdrawal limit of PKR 4 billion (against invoices from IPPs). The Government of Pakistan acknowledged, at the time, that this '[would] not fully fulfill the revolving account requirements under the RAA, but it [would] provide additional comfort to Chinese IPPs’. Then, in November 2022, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet turned down a proposal by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) for the PERF (escrow) account to be operated by the National Bank of Pakistan. It decided that the account would instead be operated by the country’s central bank: the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). Then, in March 2023, CPHGC warned that it was at risk of defaulting on its loan repayment obligations due to overdue power purchase payments from the Central Power Purchasing Agency-Guaranteed (CPPA-G)"

The borrower, ASDPL, was expected to use the loan proceeds to partially finance two commercial (EPC) contracts that it signed on on June 27, 2015: an RMB 863.316 million offshore supply contract that it signed with China First Metallurgical Group Co. Ltd. and an RMB 135.683 million onshore construction contract with MCC Ruba International Construction Company (Pvt) Ltd. The total project cost was $149.154 million and it was financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 79:21. ASDPL achieved financial close on November 6, 2015, which is typically the date of the first loan disbursement.   The project was implemented on a build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT) basis and it involved the construction of a 100 MW solar PV power plant located at Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park at Lal Sohanra in Cholistan within Bahawalpur District of the Province of Punjab. China First Metallurgical Group Co. Ltd and MCC Ruba International Construction Company (Pvt) Ltd were the EPC contractors responsible for project implementation. This project reached its commercial operations date (COD) on May 31, 2016.   However, this project has encountered debt repayment and financial management challenges since the power plant went into operation. In May 2022, reports emerged that the Government of Pakistan’s Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) had fallen behind on payments (for the purchase of electricity) to Zonergy and its subsidiaries/SPVs. Total payment arrears, at that time, amounted to PKR 10.4 billion (approximately $52 million). Several months later, on October 26, 2022, Sinosure informed the Government of Pakistan that it would not be able to provide credit insurance for any additional projects in Pakistan without ‘early resolution of [the] Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) pending between Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Chinese IPPs since 2017’. Under a November 8, 2014 CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement, the CPPA and Chinese IPPs had agreed on the establishment of an RAA to facilitate the automatic payment of at least 22% payables to IPPs directly through the recovery of electricity bills of distribution companies (so-called ‘discos’). However, ‘due to various technical and financial constraints’, the Government of Pakistan’s Power Division acknowledged that the RAA had not been implemented over the previous 5-year period. In May 2022, an effort to establish an RAA was undertaken by the Government of Pakistan, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.   Then, on October 31, 2022, Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance came up with an interim arrangement for the Power Division to open ‘an assignment under the title of Pakistan Energy Revolving Fund (PERF) till such time matters pertaining to RAA are resolved’. The escrow account was to be opened at the National Bank of Pakistan and operated by the CPPA and PKR 50 billion was to be allocated from the Ministry of Finance’s subsidy account to the PERF with a monthly withdrawal limit of PKR 4 billion (against invoices from IPPs). The Government of Pakistan acknowledged, at the time, that this “[would] not fully fulfill the revolving account requirements under the RAA, but it [would] provide additional comfort to Chinese IPPs’. Then, in November 2022, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet turned down a proposal by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) for the PERF (escrow) account to be operated by the National Bank of Pakistan. It decided that the account would instead be operated by the country’s central bank: the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP)."

Bank of China's contribution to the syndicate is captured via Project ID#89647. The loan carried a 2-year maturity and an unknown interest rate.  The loan was secured by (i.e. collateralized against) trust pledges on the assets of Empresa de Generación Huallaga SA, a trust over the cash flows of Empresa de Generación Huallaga SA, and accounts and shares issued by the borrower. The Bank of New York Mellon acted as offshore collateral agent, while Scotiabank Perú acted as onshore agent and trustee and ICBC Perú acted as debt and equity escrow agent.  The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to (a) acquire Empresa de Generación Huallaga S.A. (EGH) from Odebrecht Energía del Perú SA and Odebrecht Energía SA for $1.39 billion; and (b) pay off the liabilities of EGH to a bank syndicate (consisting of Inter-American Development Bank, BNDES, and Deutsche Bank) that financed the hydroelectric plant during the project’s greenfield stage. The acquisition, which was funded with debt and equity contributions from the owners of Chaglla Holdings Limited, was completed on April 25, 2019.  Empresa de Generación Huallaga (EGH) is a project company and was the owner and operator of the 456MW Chaglla hydroelectric power generation plant and related assets, including all transmission lines to interconnect the plant to the Peruvian national grid. The hydropower facility itself is located along the Huagalla river in the Chaglla and Chinchao districts of Peru. EGH's acquisition by Chaglla Holdings Limited effectively gave the CTG-led consortium (joint venture) ownership of the third-largest hydropower facility in Peru. EGH’s revenue is assured through 2031 thanks to a 15-year power purchase agreement (PPA) signed with state-owned Electroperú in 2011, which took effect in 2016. The PPA tender, in which only new hydroelectric projects could participate, fixed the energy price under a take-or-pay arrangement."

178,476,"China Eximbank provides $608 million loan for 1250 MW Merowe Hydroelectric Power Plant Project (Linked to Project ID#695, #56927, #56959)",2010,Sudan,"In October 2002, a joint venture called CCMD Corporation, which is between China International Water and Electric Corporation (CWE) and China Water Resources and Hydropower Engineering Corporation (CWHEC or Sinohydro), applied to China Eximbank for a loan guarantee before bidding on the 1250 MW Merowe Hydroelectric Power Plant Project in Sudan. On May 20, 2003, this Chinese consortium ended up winning three different contracts for this project:  (1) a $600 million (EUR 550 million) contract signed on June 7, 2003 for construction of the dam;  (2) a $60 million contract signed on December 23, 2003 for auxiliary projects related to the metal frame and hydraulic mechanics; and (3) a $400 million contract signed on December 23, 2003 for construction of substations and transmission lines. (Note: A $381.5 million loan for this project component is captured via Project ID#695).   On December 23, 2003, China Eximbank and the Government of Sudan signed three different loan agreements worth a total of $519 million in order to partially finance the first two contracts:  (1) a $400 million loan; (2) a $65 million loan; and (3) a $54 million loan. These loans carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a grace period between 6 and 7 years, and interest rate of 3-4%. China Eximbank later increased its total lending for the 1250 MW Merowe Hydroelectric Power Plant Project to $608 million (as captured via Project ID#178).   The total project cost is unclear but estimates range from $1 billion to $3 billion. Therefore, several other entities served as co-financiers. The 1250 MW Merowe Hydroelectric Power Plant Project was co-financed with:  (1) $250 million from Arab Fund for Social and Economic Development (and possibly an additional $211 million) (2) $150 million from the Kuwait Development Fund (and possibly an additional $50 million) (3) $150 million from the Abu Dhabi Foundation (4) $200 million from the Saudi Fund for Development (5) $15 million from the Government of Qatar (6) $106 million from the Government of Oman  (7) $575 million from the Government of Sudan  The 1250 MW Merowe Hydroelectric Power Plant Project involved the construction of a 9.7-kilometer-long and 65-meter-high dam with a total installed capacity of 1250 MW and a storage capacity at 12.4 billion cubic meters. It is located near Merowe Town in northern Sudan, about 350 kilometers (220 mi) north of the capital Khartoum. The project had 8 main components:  (1) Dam: This component included the construction of concrete and embankment sections of the dam on the Nile River channel. The dam crest was to be 9.7 km long and 10 m wide, and its height 60 m above river bed. The dam was also to include the appurtenant structures such as spillway, water intakes and sediment sluices, as well as a hydropower station.  (2) Preparatory Works: This component included the construction of housing facilities for construction supervision and operations personnel, the construction of 27 km access roads from Karima to the dam site, and a loading platform and storage areas at the nearby railway station. (3) Civil Works: This component included excavation, fill, drilling and grouting works, and concrete works for the dam and its appurtenant structures. It also included all civil works for the hydropower station, as well as all necessary instrumentation and monitoring equipment for the operation of the dam. (4) Mechanical Works: This component included the supply and installation of gates, pipes and related mechanical equipment for the dam and its appurtenant structures. (5) Hydro-Mechanical Works: This component included the supply and installation of gates, penstocks, cranes and related hydro-mechanical equipment necessary for the control of water, and operation and maintenance of the dam and its appurtenant structures. (6) Electromechanical and Electrical Works for the Power Station: This component included the furnishing and installation of ten turbines, each rated at 125 MW, and ten 150 MVA generators. It also included the construction of 500 and 220 kV switchyards, and the supply of the necessary transformers and bus bars, as well as control, protection and monitoring systems. (7) Transmission Lines: This component included the construction of 500 and 220 kV overhead lines having a total length of 1700 km, as well as seven sub-stations. (8) Consultancy Services: This component included the consultancy services required to review the conceptual design, prepare the detailed design, and construction supervision.  The project owner was Sudan’s Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources’ Merowe Dam Implementation Unit. The contractors responsible for implementation included China International Water and Electric Corporation (CWE), Sinohydro, Harbin Power Engineering Company (HPEC), and Alstom, a French company.   The originally anticipated project commencement and completion dates were July 30, 2005 and July 30, 2008, respectively. The project began construction on July 8, 2003, and the first two generators were officially connected to the national grid on March 3, 2009. However, it was not until April 8, 2010 that the tenth unit of the Merowe dam was officially connected to the grid. However; issues with silt and debris accumulation threaten the long-term life of the dam. By 2020, the dam had lost 1.7% of its holding capacity.  According to a 2015 book (entitled "Water, Civilisation and Power in Sudan") by Harry Verhoeven, Dr. Sabir Mohamed Hassan (the Governor of the Central Bank of Sudan) has "described one of the reasons for prioritising Merowe as 'the government needed something big to show to the people'. It was no coincidence that Omar Al-Bashir campaigned for the Sudanese presidency in April 2010 with a picture of himself in front of the Merowe Dam, the symbol of civilisation delivered by Al-Ingaz, as his main electoral poster."  The project was awarded the Luban Prize, a master prize in the PRC for development projects. However, it was also plagued by controversy.  The project participants were required to prepare or contract an environmental impact assessment (EIA) in accordance with specific guidelines that address three major topics:  (1) Social issues -- consequences of people resettlement from future flooded area;  and (2) Archeological issues -- resulting from destruction or submerging important archeological sites or places of high cultural value; and (3) Environmental issues -- effect of large scale hydrological alteration of the natural river system with major impacts on the environment and water quality.   In April 2002, Lahmeyer International prepared the EIA report for the Merowe Dam Project. The report focused on complex resettlement issues involving about 7500 families. Among the environmental impacts it discussed were the hydrological changes, the erosion of the river bed and its banks, greenhouse gas emissions, and changes in the aquatic ecosystem. The 150 page report was far from meeting European or international standards, such as the guidelines of the World Commission on Dams. No serious attempt was made to use the vast scientific knowledge base on environmental effects of large dams, although four decades of research on the Aswan High Dam (Lake Nasser in Egypt, Lake Nubia in Sudan) had revealed a dramatic sediment accumulation in the upper part of the reservoir, problematic water quality issues and detrimental downstream effects such as river bed erosion or water level fluctuations. An estimated 60,000 civilians were ultimately displaced during the construction of the dam. Sudanese civilians protested the project’s execution from the start, and in a confrontation with authorities in April 2006, five people from a displaced community were killed.  There are also some indications that the loans that were issued for the construction of the Merowe Hydroelectric Power Plant may have underperformed vis-a-vis lender expectations. According to Sudan’s Finance Minister Ali Mahmood Abdel-Rasool, China Eximbank suspended its financing for 11 projects in Sudan following the secession of South Sudan in July 2011, which triggered a major loss of oil revenue (a key source of collateral for China Eximbank loans). Ali Mahmood Abdel-Rasool said at the time that the Government of Sudan had previously pledged oil revenues (worth 120,000 barrels per day) to China Eximbank as a source of collateral. Then, on February 18, 2012, the Chinese Government announced that it had agreed to reschedule the outstanding debt obligations of the Government of Sudan by extending loan repayment periods by 5 years (as captured via Project ID#30421). According to the External Debt Unit of the Central Bank of Sudan, the Government of Sudan's total arrears to Chinese creditors amounted to $3.864 billion ($2.608 billion in principal, $1.129 billion in interest, and $127 million in penalty interest) as of March 31, 2022."

The purpose of the project was to install a 153MW wind farm with 102 turbines near the city of Adama in a range of rocky hills in the Ethiopian highlands 100 kilometers southeast of the capital Addis Ababa. The project also involved the construction of 10 km worth of electricity transmission lines to connect the wind farm to the 230kv grid via the Koka substation.   Hydrochina-CGCOC JV — a joint venture between Hydrochina Corporation, and CGC Overseas Construction Co. Ltd. (CGCOC) — was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Upon completion, it was expected that the Adama II Wind Farm would be able to generate about 476 million kWh electricity every year, thereby meeting over 20% of the electricity needs of the capital city of Ethiopia.  It was also expected that by substituting oil power plants of the same scale, the Adama I Wind Farm and Adama II Wind Farm could together save 160,000 tons of fuel oil and reduce almost 600,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions. Hydrochina Corporation was responsible for the project’s feasibility study. CGCOC was responsible for the project’s mechanical work. Sany Heavy Industry Co., Ltd. — another Chinese company — was responsible for the provision of the wind turbines. Construction started in June 2013. During the construction phase, in order to avoid dust and sand, water was sprayed on the excavated earth.  In order to minimize the impact of traffic noise and dust brought by vehicle transportation during construction, Hydrochina-CGCOC JV strictly controlled and managed the driving times and routes. Speed bumps were set up on a windy road to reduce dust blown by fast-driving vehicles. Trees, flowers and plants were grown around the booster stations. Hydrochina-CGCOC JV also built stone drainage and afforested slopes near the assembly site of wind turbines, thereby preventing soil erosion. Local floral and fauna species were reportedly protected. An official inauguration ceremony for the Adama Wind Farm II (Adama II Wind Farm) took place on May 18, 2015. The wind farm was then transferred to the project owner (EEPCO) and put into operation in June 2016. The 153MW Adama Wind Farm II Project reportedly created thousands of jobs for local people during the construction phase and continued to provide hundreds of jobs for local people during the operation phase.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Adama Wind Farm II Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.

According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), 15 loan disbursements (worth ETB 21,904,463,534) took place between 2012 and 2019: an ETB 1,102,591,696 disbursement on January 8, 2012, an ETB 1,256,266,119 disbursement on April 8, 2012, and an ETB 241,864,376 disbursement on October 10, 2012, an ETB 519,482,004 disbursement on April 8, 2013, an ETB 149,053,030 disbursement on October 7, 2013, an ETB 1,120,000,000 disbursement on October 7, 2014, an ETB 323,232,323 disbursement on January 7, 2015, an ETB 450,503,881 disbursement on October 7, 2015, an ETB 200,679,002 disbursement on January 7, 2016, an ETB 286,223,972 disbursement on April 7, 2016, an ETB 164,701,197 disbursement on July 7,, 2016, an ETB 1,359,428,420 disbursement on April 7, 2017, an ETB 116,911,052 disbursement on July 7, 2017, an ETB 1,045,494,392 disbursement on March 20, 2018, and an ETB 13,568,032,070 disbursement on September 9, 2019.  The purpose of the project was to supply and install electrical and mechanical equipment (turbines) for the construction of the Gilgel Gibe III Dam (also known as the Gibe III Dam). The Gilgel Gibe III Dam is 610 m-long (2,000 ft) and 243 m (797 ft) high roller-compacted concrete dam. It withholds a reservoir with a capacity of 14.7 km3 (3.5 cu mi) and a surface area of 210 km2 (81 sq mi), collecting with a catchment area of 34,150 km2 (13,190 sq mi). The reservoir's live (active or ‘useful’) storage is 11.75 km3 (2.82 cu mi) and dead storage 2.95 km3 (0.71 cu mi). The normal operating level of the reservoir is 892 m (2,927 ft) above sea level with a maximum of 893 m (2,930 ft) and minimum of 800 m (2,600 ft). The dam's spillway is 108 m (354 ft) long and floodgate-controlled with a maximum discharge capacity of 18,000 m3/s (640,000 cu ft/s). Water above 873 m (2,864 ft) above sea level can be discharged through its gates. Feeding the dam's power house are two penstocks that each branch into five separate tunnels for each individual turbine. The power house contains ten 187 MW generators supported by Francis turbines for a total installed capacity of 1,870 MW.   DEC was responsible for the electro-mechanical and hydraulic steel structure works component of the project. Salini Costruttori S.p.A.(SPA), an Italian contractor, completed the civil engineering construction of the project.   The electro-mechanical portion of the project involved the design; build; site testing and commission of 10 vertical type hydraulic turbines; 10 vertical axis synchronous generators; and other transformer-related tasks. The hydro mechanical portion included the installation of steel structures; gates; a draft tube; a diversion tunnel; a spillway and ecological discharge gates.   The construction of the Gibe III dam began in July 2006 along the Omo River but the project provoked a backlash from environmental activists. The African Development Bank and the European Investment Bank were originally supposed to fund the electro-mechanical costs for the project, but they eventually backed out due to the project's perceived negative environmental and social impacts. In August 2015, Ethiopia commissioned the first phase of electricity generation at the Gibe III plant from three turbines with an output of 561MW. Then, on December 17, 2016, the Gibe III dam was officially inaugurated. The plant has 10 turbines each with a capacity of 187MW equaling a total capacity of 1,870MW, increasing Ethiopia's total electricity output to 4,238 megawatts. This project also reportedly created more than 7,000 jobs.  There are some indications that the ICBC loan for the 1870MW Gilgel Gibe III Hydropower Project  may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country’ (see Project ID#58616). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs. The CF debt rescheduling talks were still ongoing in mid-2023."

The purpose of the project was to construct the 254MW Genale-Dawa III multipurpose hydropower plant. The plant consists of a concrete faced rock fill dam and an underground powerhouse. Based on the estimated sedimentation level, the project will have a lifetime of more than 1,000 years. The dam site is located in a low seismic hazard area of class I. The dam is 110m high, 456m wide and 450m long. It is made with groutable and non-erodible rock and has a volume of 3.2 million cubic metres (mm3). At the full capacity, the dam can store up to 2,570mm3 of water. It has a catchment area of 10,445km2 and a fill volume of 890,000m3. The dam spillway is an open chute type with an ogee weir crest and three radial spillway gates. The underground powerhouse is installed with three vertical Francis turbine generators with a capacity of 84.7MW each. It is housed within an underground cavern measuring 60m-long, 20m-wide and 41m deep and also includes auxiliary equipment. A 12.4km long, 8.1m diameter headrace tunnel carries water from the dam through a 188m deep steel-lined vertical shaft to a three-pronged manifold. The manifold feeds the water to the turbine inlet valves of the three turbines housed in the powerhouse. A 820m long tailrace tunnel and a 480m long open channel returns the water back to the river. A transformer cavern is located downstream of the powerhouse and includes three step-up transformers. The electricity generated is transferred from the transformers to a 230kV/400kV switchyard located above ground through a 500m long cable tunnel.   The project area is located in Kobadi, some 400 km (air distance) south-east of Addis Ababa and some 200 km (air distance) north of the border with Kenya. The scheme, including the reservoir and power waterways, extends over a river corridor some 55 km long. The approximate centroid of the project area lies at latitude 5º 38' North and longitude 39º 43' East.   CGGC was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. However, several other contractors were involved in the project. Stantec, a US-based company, provided design, planning, management and consulting services. Lahmeyer International, a German company, conducted the feasibility study. Tunnelpro, an Italy-based supplier, provided tunnel boring machines.   Project implementation commenced in March 2011 and the project was originally expected to commence on January 1, 2010 and reach completion within 48.5 months (January 15, 2014). However, the project encountered multiple implementation delays. An inauguration ceremony was held to commemorate the project’s completion on February 4, 2020.

The purpose of the project was to construct the 97MW Fincha-Amerti-Neshi (FAN) hydroelectric power plant — also known as the Neshe multipurpose dam — on the Neshi River in the Blue Nile catchment within Eastern Wolega Zone in Oromia Regional State. Upon completion, it was envisaged that the multi-purpose dam would enable the irrigation of a 6,000 hectare plot nearby, where sugarcane is grown by the state-owned Fincha Sugar Factory (also known as the Finchaa Sugar Estate).   CGGC was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Dam construction started on July 22, 2010. The project was originally scheduled for completion on August 25, 2011. It was ultimately completed on November 17, 2011. A formal inauguration ceremony was held on December 17, 2011. Project implementation challenges and delays reportedly include a 24-month delay in the approval of the China Eximbank loan, power interruptions, and logistical problems while transporting construction materials from Djibouti port. According to field interview evidence collected by Detlef Müller-Mahn and Million Gebreyes, the implementation of the project also provoked two sets of concerns among local residents: ‘First, there is a general feeling of unfairness, because apparently information about the new project and its opportunities was not made generally available. Secondly, and worse than that, many people complain about broken promises and disappointed expectations, especially with regard to the payment of compensation and the organization of the out-grower scheme adjacent to the sugar cane plantation. Many respondents confirmed that compensation for land that was taken for the new dam was not paid as originally agreed, which, as they explain, was due to insufficient asset valuations, incorrect surveys, mismanagement, and corruption. Tensions in connection with the project were further aggravated when some of the resettled families realized that the new houses they had been given in the lowland area close to the sugar cane plantation were not as nice as they had expected and that living conditions in that location were not favorable. For that reason, many families left the new settlement again and went back to the highlands. They abandoned their new homes and the land they had been given. However, as out-growers they were no longer free in their decision about what to cultivate and where to live, but had to grow sugar cane for the factory. In 2017, when the farm managers of the sugar cane plantation realized that the land of the out-growers was no longer cultivated, they started to plant it with sugar cane. This again caused a major uproar among the settlers who claimed that the sugar company should pay rent to them. The company did so in the first year, but when it refused to do so in the second year, people threatened that they would burn the plantation and attack the factory. As a consequence, almost 2000 hectares of the out-grower scheme were left without cultivation."

All subsidiary loans approved under the buyer’s credit facility agreement (captured via Project ID#45047) carried the following borrowing terms: a 13-year maturity and an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 2-3% margin. All of the subsidiary loans were secured with (i.e., collateralized against) Ethiopia's export receipts to China, which at the time primarily consisted of sesame seed export receipts. The buyer’s credit facility agreement also required that all Ethiopian exports (export receipts) to China to be overseen by the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, the country’s largest state-owned financial institution. 16 subsidiary loans for 16 different projects were reportedly approved under the buyer’s credit facility agreement. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), China Eximbank and the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE)— an Ethiopian state-owned bank — signed a subsidiary buyer’s credit loan worth approximately $125.205 million (ETB 1,082,214,356) for the 97MW Neshe Multipurpose Dam Construction Project on September 20, 2007.  The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance approximately 85% of the cost of a $147.3 million (ETB 1.3 billon) commercial contract between the Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCo) — an Ethiopian state-owned enterprise — and China Gezhouba Group Corporation (CGGC), which was signed in December 2006.

The estimated borrowing terms of the PBC are follows: a 0% interest rate, no grace period, and a 19.9-year maturity. The borrower was to use the loan proceeds to finance approximately 85% of the cost of an EPC (commercial) contract, which it signed with Shandong Electric Power Construction Corporation III (SEPCOIII, SEPCO3, or 山东电力建设第三工程公司) on July 25, 2013 (following an international call for tenders). The specified duration of the EPC contract was 36 months, beginning on December 31, 2014 and ending on December 30, 2017.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 318-megawatt coal-fired plant in "Hassi Blal" near the city of Jerada. The location of the plant is close to the country’s border with Algeria and approximately 60 km south of the city of Oujda (in eastern Morocco). The plant was to be built on the same site as an existing 165MW Jerada power plant, thereby increasing total on-site power generation capacity to approximately 483 MW. The existing plant was made up of three 55MW units operating on pulverized coal. Coal transport from the port of Nador was provided by train and truck. The new plant was also designed to operate on pulverized coal and the electricity that it produced was to be evacuated to the Bourdim substation via two new 400 kV transmission lines. Emergency power was to be provided by a new 60 kV transmission line. The two 400 kV lines and the 60 kV line were to be built by ONEE.  A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on November 19, 2014. However, construction began on October 3, 2014. The power plant started generating electricity on September 19, 2017 and it was put into commercial operation ahead of schedule on December 18, 2017. Some sources suggest that, upon completion, the power generation capacity of the plant was 350MW rather than 318MW. A post-loan project inspection was undertaken by China Eximbank on June 25, 2019."

The borrowing terms of this ICBC loan are unknown. The total cost of the Noor II CSP Independent Power Project (IPP) was EUR 834.5 million.  The project was implemented on a public-private partnership (PPP) basis) and co-financed by the Government of Morocco, the World Bank, the African Development Bank, European Investment Bank (EIB), KFW, the Clean Technology Fund (CTF), and various private sector sponsors. It was the second in a series of projects at the Ouarzazate solar complex.   The Noor II CSP IPP was based on the parabolic trough CSP technology with a capacity of 200 MW and 7 hours of storage developed on a BOO basis. The solar power plant comprises a solar field, a turbine and a thermal power-storage facility.  Shandong Electric Power Construction Co., Ltd (SEPCO III), a subsidiary of Power Construction Corporation of China, was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began in May 2015 and the power plant was put into commercial operation on April 24, 2018.   The initial commercial operation date (ICOD) of the power plant was contractually set at August 27, 2017 but could not be met due to delays affecting the project and the force majeure claimed by APO II, and was thus extended by 160 days to February 3, 2018, considered the new required initial commercial operation date (RICOD) of the NOOR Ouarzazate II power plant. It should also be noted that following the suspension of land transportation authorisations for exceptional convoys (heavy equipment) due to significant damage caused to several structures by severe weather on October 26, 2016, the delivery of heavy equipment, initially scheduled for November 2016, was delayed and was made only at the end of May 2017. As a result of the suspension of land transportation, APO II requested additional 187 days because of the force majeure.   The initial commercial operation date (ICOD) of the NOOR Ouarzazate II power plant, initially set at August 27, 2017, could not be met due to several factors, some of which have been listed above (difficulties in transportation and logistics). It was postponed, after MASEN accepted the force majeure claimed by APO II, to February 3, 2018 considered as the new required initial commercial operation date (RICOD) for the power plant. The first synchronisation of the plant to the power grid was conducted on January 10, 2018. The plant's initial commercial operation date was April 24, 2018, following successful completion of performance and reliability tests conducted in March 2018 and 24 April 2018 when the thermal energy storage system started working again. Some conditions were waived, such as certain atmospheric emissions and noise tests (these tests were successfully completed on September 26, 2018 and September 29, 2018). The Initial Commercial Operation Certificate, which confirmed completion of the initial commercial operation date (ICOD) of NOOR Ouarzazate II on April 24, 2018, was issued by the Project Company on September 18, 2018.

Its work was overseen by Corporación Eléctrica del Ecuador (CELEC) and Ministerio de Electricidad y Energía Renovable (MEER). Construction began in March 2012. The excavation of a diversion tunnel was completed in August 2013. The diversion of the Jubones River took place in February 2014. Then, in January 2015, the excavation of the entrance window to the head tunnel was complete. The completion of the powerhouse excavation took place in October 2015. Then, in December 2016, the construction and assembly of the transmission line was completed. The power plant’s three generator rotors were lowered into place between January 2017 and May 2017. The filling of the reservoir occurred in December 2017. Then, in May 2018, the first rotation of the first turbine-generator took place. As of August 2018, the project had achieved a 99.7% completion rate. All three power generation units were connected to the grid on October 24, 2018. The first power generation unit was officially inaugurated on January 15, 2019. The project’s official handover ceremony took place on April 9, 2021.   To date, the power plant has reportedly generated over 140 million kWh power, created more than 2,000 jobs, and delivered electricity on a daily basis to nearly 1.2 million people and 2,000 manufacturing companies. However, the project suffered multiple setbacks due to administrative and technical discrepancies with contractors and inspectors, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic. The China Eximbank loan (BCL) that supported this project also underperformed. It was rescheduled twice — once in September 2020 (as captured via Project ID#93434) and again in September 2022 (as captured via Project ID#96295)."

The Coca Codo Sinclair hydroelectric project was first proposed in the early 1980s but could not be implemented because of the Reventador volcanic eruption in 1987 and financial constraints. Then, in 2007, Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa restarted the project and Italian company Electroconsult was contracted to conduct a new feasibility study. In February 2008, Coca Codo Sinclair SA was established as a joint venture company between Ecuador’s state-owned power company Termopichincha (70% ownership stake) and Energia Argentina (30% ownership stake). The Government of Ecuador then bought the entire 30% ownership stake of Energia Argentina for $5.5 million in September 2009. Coca Codo Sinclair E.P. — a project company (special purpose vehicle) — was eventually established to oversee the design and implementation of the Coca Codo Sinclair Hydroelectric Project. Its sole shareholder is La Corporación Eléctrica del Ecuador E.P. (CELEC), an Ecuadorian state-owned holding company engaged in electricity generation, transmission, distribution, and commercialization.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 1500 MW hydroelectric power plant in El Reventador on the Coca River between the provinces of Napo and Sucumbíos. The plant’s eight turbines were designed to produce 8.8 billion kWh per annum, supplying 35% of the country’s overall electricity consumption and saving about two billion liters of imported diesel for thermal power plants per year. The project was developed in an area where the Coca River flows in a great curve at a natural slope of 620 meters. The water intake complex is located on the Coca River, 1 km downstream of the confluence of the Quijos and Salado rivers. It comprises a concrete face rockfill dam built on the existing river channel, a concrete spillway built on the left bank of the river, and the sedimentation basin and intake built between the dam and spillway. Any water diverted from the intake passes via the 120 meter-long sedimentation basin to run through a 24.8 km-long concrete-lined headrace tunnel, with an excavation diameter of 9.1 meters, into the compensating reservoir, which has a usable volume 800,000m³. Water from the compensating reservoir is fed through two 1,900 meter-long penstocks to the eight Pelton turbines installed in the underground powerhouse, which measure 26m x 50m x 192m. A parallel cavern of 16.5m x 33m x 192m houses 24 single-phase transformers of 68.3 MVA each and a 500kV substation. The access path to the powerhouse is 495m long, 6.5m wide and 7.5m high. A tailrace tunnel delivers water back to the Coca River. The hydroelectric project is designed to use a 620 meter-high natural waterfall with a maximum regulated flow of water of 278m³/s. Coca Codo’s run-of-river intake has a maximum capacity of 7,500m³/s. The sedimentation basin has six bays and a design sediment particles size of 0.25mm, while the maximum derived flow in the headrace tunnel is 222m³/s. Two penstocks with vertical shaft and horizontal reach feed the water from the compensating reservoir to the eight generating units of the plant. In addition, the power plant is equipped with eight six-nozzle vertical Pelton turbines, each with a rated output of 187.7MW. Each turbine is powered by a runner with 22 buckets with a width of 835mm.   Sinohydro was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation and its work was overseen by Coca Codo Sinclair E.P. and CELEC. Project implementation commenced on July 28, 2010. The access road to the powerhouse was completed in October 2012. A tunnel collapse at the plant construction site killed 13 people and injured 12 in December 2014. It also caused partial damage to the high-pressure pipes inside the engine room. The project was ultimately completed on November 18, 2016. Its originally scheduled completion date was January 28, 2016.   Since then, the project has been plagued by a variety of engineering problems and corruption accusations.  In 2017, the Ecuadorian tax authority (SRI) uncovered pending taxes of $198 million from Sinohydro. One of the main controversies involved a payment of $172.5 million by Sinhohydro to China Export and Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure) for the purchase of an insurance policy, for which Sinohydro sought tax deductions, which SRI rejected. Then, in December 2018, the New York Times reported that ‘7,648 cracks have developed in the dam’s machinery, according to the government, because of substandard steel and inadequate welding by Sinohydro. Sand and silt are also big concerns because they can damage vital equipment.’  In May 2021, CELEC requested arbitration through the International Chamber of Commerce to settle a dispute over cracks in the power plant’s machinery that prevented it from operating at full capacity since it was completed in 2016 (after $2.2 billion in construction costs). Then, in July 2021, Reuters reported that new problems at the hydroelectric plant threatened water flow and electricity generation. During a shutdown of four of the facility’s eight turbines for planned maintenance, CELEC discovered missing bolts on some of its valves. CELEC CEO Gonzalo Uquillas said that the problem could prevent valves from opening and closing to adequately regulate the flow of water. ‘Of the 96 bolts that secure the seals on these valves, some bolts are missing,’ Uquillas said in an interview on July 16, 2021. He added that ‘I don’t want to believe they weren’t installed, but they are missing.’ Then, in March 2023, Ecuador's Prosecutor General filed charges against 37 people, including the former President of Ecuador Lenín Moreno (2017-2021) and five former employees of Sinohydro (Cai Runguo, Yan Huijun, Song Dongsheng, Wu Yu, and Liu Aisheg) for allegedly accepting bribes worth $1.1 million to secure the commercial contract for the 1500MW Coca Codo Sinclair Hydroelectric Facility Project.  The China Eximbank loan (BCL) that supported the Coca Codo Sinclair Hydroelectric Project has also financially underperformed. It was rescheduled twice — once in September 2020 (as captured via Project ID#93431) and again in September 2022 (as captured via Project ID#96292)."

It was part of an allocation of USD 5.5 billion from the China Venezuela Joint Fund to build power plants (see project ID#37833). According to CAMCE, the original contract was worth USD 956 million. According to a 2018 National Assembly report, the original investment was USD 804 million. The cost eventually expanded to USD 1.045 billion.  The first turbine was put into use on July 31, 2013. The second turbine was connect on November 25, 2013. The third turbine was connected on January 27, 2015. The project reached full load on July 10, 2015. By this point, the total government investment in the project had increased to USD 1.145 billion. The primary contractor was CAMC. China Energy Engineering Company (CEEC) and WorleyParsons also worked on the project. The project involved two 200 MW combined cycle Siemens turbines, and one 170 MW steam turbine.  This project had a number of issues. The attorney for CAMC was called before a special commission of the National Assembly on May 4, 2016, to account for the massive cost overruns on this and other CAMC projects in Venezuela. The special commission also found that while costs had reached USD 1.145 billion, the value of the work done was only USD 317 million, a 60% markup. It was alleged in a 2019 lawsuit in Andorra that CAMC paid bribes worth EUR 31 million to secure the Don Zambrano contract.   There was a fire on March 12, 2018 that destroyed turbines 1 and 3. By 2021, the plant was generating very little electricity despite promises from Maduro to improve its capacity to 450 MW  and efforts to restore the second and third turbines."

[60% equity stake] and Power Construction Joint Stock Company No. 1 [40% equity stake] — signed a $173 million  limited recourse project financing package for the Lotus Wind Power Project: a $35 million ‘A’ loan from the Asian Development Bank (ADB); a $81 million syndicated ‘B’ loan from Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited; Bank of China Limited Macau Branch; Société Générale, Singapore Branch, and Triodos Groenfonds N.V.; a $25 million loan from Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA); and a $32 million loan from Export Finance Australia (EFA). The loans carried the following borrowing terms: 15-year maturities and interest rates of LIBOR plus a 3-5% margin.   The purpose of the independent power project (IPP) was to develop, construct, and operate three wind farms — the VND1.973 trillion 48MW Lien Lap Wind Power Plant; the VND1.913 trillion 48MW Phong Huy Wind Power Plant; and the VND1.911 trillion 48MW Phong Nguyen Wind Power Plant — and internal transmission lines in Quang Tri (Quảng Trị) Province. The SPVs (project companies) each have 20-year power purchase agreements (PPAs) with state-owned monopoly electricity distributor Vietnam Electricity (EVN) under a feed-in tariff (FIT) of $0.085 per kWh.    Danish wind power company Vestas Wind System was awarded the contract to install 36x V150-4.2MW wind turbines.  Each wind power plant achieved a commercial operation date in October 2021. The originally scheduled COD for each wind power plant was October 31, 2021.     ADB helped design and enforce the gender equality and safeguarding measures integrated into the Lotus Wind Power Project. The gender equality measures were to be enforced at the parent company level (i.e., on PPC1), while safeguarding measures at the subsidiary level (i.e., Lien Lap Joint Stock Company, Phong Huy Joint Stock Company, and Phong Nguyen Joint Stock Company). The gender equality measures stemmed from a clearly defined process undertaken by ADB that involved sending the parent company (PC1) a due diligence questionnaire. The questionnaire assessed the company’s baseline practices for integrating gender equality measures across business functions, including procurement, service and product delivery, training and development, and workplace policies. Armed with the results of this questionnaire and in consultation with the parent company, ADB developed a Gender Action Plan (GAP), which included specific targets for PC1, e.g., for the number of jobs provided to women during the construction phase of project, as well as for the number of women managers employed by PC1 and its subsidiaries; development of an anti-sexual harassment policy and training of staff on the policy; and inclusion of women from the local community (for the first time) in PC1’s vocational training on wind power operation and management. The safeguarding measures proposed for the project stemmed from the ADB classification as category B on environment, involuntary resettlement, and Indigenous Peoples. On the latter, the ADB considered the impacts of the project on ethnic minority groups. As a result, the ADB required Phong Huy Wind and Lien Lap to develop a combined Livelihood Restoration and Ethnic Minority Development Plan (LREMDP) and Phong Nguyen was required to develop an Ethnic Minority Development Plan (EMDP). The plans aimed to mitigate the impact of the project on ethnic minorities and socially and economically vulnerable groups, including households led by women."

In exchange for hiring CNEEC, the Government of Zambia requested that China Eximbank extend a preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) for both projects and that CNEEC arrange the financing. In 2013, China Eximbank and the Government of Zambia signed a $183.23 million PBC agreement for the 86MW Lusiwasi Lower Hydropower Expansion Project and the 15MW Lunzua Hydropower Rehabilitation Project. The borrowing terms of the PBC are unknown. According to a 2014 report from Zambia’s Office of the Auditor General (source ID#67159), the proceeds of the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance (a) 85% ($139,353,132) of the cost of a commercial contract ($163,944,861.43) between ZESCO Limited and CNEEC for the 86MW Lusiwasi Lower Hydropower Expansion Project, which was signed on July 21, 2011; and (b)  85% ($44.2 million) of the cost of a commercial contract ($52 million) between ZESCO Limited and CNEEC for the 14.8MW Lunzua Hydropower Rehabilitation Project, which was signed on July 21, 2011. The remaining 15% was to be provided by the Government of Zambia in counterpart financing. The 14.8MW Lunzua Hydropower Rehabilitation Project involved the construction of a 14.8 MW hydro power plant along the Lunzua River, upstream of the existing 0.75 MW power plant (exact locational coordinates: -9.008021886558053, 31.39704686153931).   The project was originally scheduled to reach completion on September 7, 2014.  However, it encountered implementation delays. CNEEC mobilized to the project site at the end of September 2012 to prepare for commencement of main works. It commenced the final commissioning of the generating plant in September 2014. The project was ultimately completed on April 9, 2015. However, it has also become a source of local concern and controversy. One source of concern that emerged was overpricing and the fact that the CNEEC was selected as the contractor through a sole-source contract rather than through a competitive bidding process. Additionally, a Government of Zambia inquiry into CNEEC’s background revealed that the company did not perform to the required standards of good workmanship and quality delivery on previous contracts. ZESCO Limited eventually notified CNEEC of its intentions to terminate their commercial contract. Then, in October 2011, Government of Zambia made the decision to terminate the commercial contract with CNEEC. However, CNEEC was not willing to refund an advance payment of $32,334,632.75 that ZESCO Limited provided between December 21, 2010 and August 23, 2011. Upon consultation between the Government of Zambia and ZESCO Limited, it was decided that the commercial contract would be reinstated in order to avoid the additional costs that would arise from termination. More specifically, a "no-objection" was granted as per China Eximbank's request. Upon reinstating CNEEC in June 2012, ZESCO Limited agreed with CNEEC that the implementation would start with the 14.8MW Lunzua Hydropower Rehabilitation Project, and upon completion of that project, the contractor would proceed to implement the 86MW Lusiwasi Lower Hydropower Expansion Project. Also, in December 2015, a physical inspection of the project by Zambia’s Office of the Auditor General revealed several problems, including defects in the construction of the hydropower station. The Office of the Auditor General flagged that the ‘bridge on the access road to the power station had collapsed’ and the ‘office block was not in use despite having been completed’. It also noted that ‘a number of items still needed to be put into operation to provide a [hydropower generation] facility fit for commercial operations namely the telecommunication system and inter-tripping for the Mbala power line."

The project was designed to address a power deficit in Zambia. It would involve the construction of a 140-meter high concrete-face rock fill dam (CFRD) with a length of approximately 378 meters. A surface powerhouse and five generator units would also be built. It was originally envisaged that the project would be completed by 2021 and created approximately 5,000 jobs. China Development Bank (CDB) was slated to provided financing to the project. The total cost of the project was reported to be $2 billion at the time. China’s Ministry of Commerce announced that a commencement ceremony for the project was scheduled for July 20, 2011.   However, after a change of government in 2011, Zambia’s incoming Minister of Finance questioned whether the project would be sufficiently beneficial to Zambia and whether there were adequate transparency and control mechanisms in place. He wanted a second opinion regarding the technical solutions proposed by the Chinese side. The Government of Norway was asked to review the plans and give further advice, but the Norwegian Government did not wish to be involved. The Government of Zambia nevertheless decided to ‘unpack’ the original proposal and looked for alternative funding and investors. It suspended its MOU with Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. and CADF.   However, after an open tendering process, Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. re-won the EPC contract on October 19, 2015. The project was ultimately financed as a public-private partnership (PPP) with a 85:15 debt-to-equity ratio. A special purpose vehicle called the Kafue Gorge Lower (KGL) Power Development Corporation Limited (KGLPDC) was created to manage the implementation of this PPP. It is wholly-owned by Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation (ZESCO) Limited, a state-owned power company. Then, on November 13, 2017, Kafue Gorge Lower (KGL) Power Development Corporation Limited signed a $1,530,576,039.16 syndicated buyer’s credit facility agreement with China Eximbank and ICBC for the 750MW Kafue Gorge Lower Hydro Power Plant Construction Project. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the cost of a commercial (EPC) contract with Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. ZESCO Limited reportedly agreed to cover the remaining 15% through an equity contribution, even though it had already made an $186 million equity investment in the project (with some of the proceeds from a $750 million Eurobond issuance in September 2012). China Eximbank’s estimated contribution to the loan is captured via Project ID#57536 and ICBC’s estimated contribution to the loan is captured via Project ID#92289. The final facility (loan) agreement included 87 loan conditions, none of which has been made public. Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. reportedly pushed to help the Government of Zambia complete all conditions before the syndicate would commit to finalizing the facility agreement. Zambia’s Ministry of Finance provided a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan and Sinosure provided a credit insurance policy (which cost the borrower approximately $100 million).   The loan had disbursed $479,000,000 as of June 21, 2018, $551,291,040 as of December 31, 2018, $887,520,697 as of December 31, 2019, $932,015,102 as of December 31, 2020, and $1,200,000,000 as of January 2020. The loan’s amount outstanding was $965,692,012 (inclusive of $16,843,994 in interest arrears) as of June 30, 2021, $981,586,149 (inclusive of $32,738,132 in interest arrears) as of June 30, 2022, and $993,836,899 (inclusive of $44,988,881 in interest arrears) as of December 31, 2022.  Construction began on January 15, 2016. However, the first loan disbursement (worth $479 million) from China Eximbank and ICBC did not occur until June 21, 2018. ZESCO Limited also hired a Norwegian private company, Norconsult, to act as its technical advisor and quality controller to ensure that Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. and other contractors honor their contractual obligations and international standards. BelFone Communications was contracted to a wireless communication system for the plant. Significant progress was made between 2016 and 2019: the North Western Province was connected to the national electricity grid following the commissioning of a 132 KV transmission line; costly diesel generation machines were decommissioned; and other transmission lines were completed to support mining projects in the region. The project had achieved a 72% completion rate by early 2020. However, the project experienced major delays in late 2019 when Sinohydro announced that it was halting its work due to the fact that it had not been paid for its services. Also, in later 2019 and early 2020, ICBC was reportedly reluctant to continue making loan disbursements due to the fact that the Government of Zambia had defaulted on its repayment obligations to several other external creditors.  Then, in January 2020, China’s Ambassador to Zambia refuted reports by Africa Confidential that the project’s lenders had suspended disbursements, resulting in a stoppage of works at the hydropower plant.  However, later that year, KGLPDC defaulted on its repayment obligations under the facility (buyer’s credit) agreement with ICBC and China Eximbank. Given that the buyer’s credit was insured by Sinosure, the EPC contractor (Sinohydro Corporation Ltd.) sought compensation through an indemnity payment. In January 2021, Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. filed an insurance claim with Sinosure, which in turn made an indemnity payment (worth $57.23 million) to Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. in May 2021.   The COVID-19 pandemic and major cost overruns also led to project implementation delays. The cost of the EPC contract with Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. reportedly increased from $1.48 billion to $2 billion, and interest payments worth $312 million during the grace period were reportedly capitalized so that the borrower would not have to make loan repayments until the power plant began generating revenue. In July 2021, during the middle of Zambia’s presidential election campaign season, one of the five turbines (Turbine Number 2) of the 750 MW Kafue Gorge Lower hydroelectric power plant was commercially commissioned and it began to supply 150 MW to the national grid. As of April 2022, ZESCO reported that two turbines at the power plant were operational and producing 300 megawatts while a third turbine was undergoing a reliability test, but there was an apparent lack of activity at the project site and neither China Eximbank nor ICBC were making any loan disbursements.  Then, in June 2022, Zambia's Energy Minister Peter Kapala announced that Kafue Gorge Lower (KGL) Power Development Corporation Limited had defaulted on its repayment obligations to China Eximbank and ICBC, and it was seeking to reschedule and restructure its outstanding debts to the Chinese creditors. He also announced that ZESCO would use internal revenues to complete the project and ensure that all turbines came online. One month later, in July 2022, China’s Ambassador to Zambia, Du Xiaohui, referred to the Kafue Gorge Lower hydroelectric power plant as a ‘a money printer made in China’ that could potentially early $1 million a day. On March 24, 2023, the fifth turbine was launched and the entire project was officially commissioned in a ceremony attended by President of Zambia Hakainde Hichilema.

The loan carries the following terms: a 15-year maturity, a 3-year grace period, and an interest rate of LIBOR plus 335 basis points. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to partially finance a commercial contract between ZESCO Limited, Jiangsu Etern Co. and Sinohydro Corporation Ltd., which was signed on or around October 2014.  As of December 31, 2017, the loan's amount outstanding was $7.4 million.   The purpose of this 2-part project was to connect Lundazi and Chama districts to the Zambian national power grid because residents were receiving unreliable power from ESCOM Malawi. It involved the construction of a 305 km, 132 kv transmission line from the Chipata sub-station to Chama via Mwansephangwe, Lundazi, Eggichickeni (Chief Magodis area) as well as four new 33kv substations in Mwasemphangwe, Lundazi, Egichikeni and Chama.   Jiangsu Etern Co. and Sinohydro Corporation Ltd were the EPC contractors responsible for project implementation. The first down payments to the two contractors were made in 2016, thus enabling the preliminary design works to commence. According to the ZESCO's 2017 Integrated Report (source ID 114272 p. 62), Sinohydro Corporation Ltd mobilized to the site and commenced works during 2017. However, Jiangsu Etern was still awaiting issuance of a Government of Zambia sovereign guarantee to achieve financial close. It expected to mobilize in the first quarter of 2018. Both projects were scheduled to last 18 months. By the end of 2018, the project had achieved a 40% completion rate. One of the transmissions lines was connected to grid on December 16, 2019.

The estimated borrowing terms of the PBC are as follows: a 2.999% interest rate, a 5.721 year grace period, and a 14.6265 maturity. It is known that the borrower was to use the PBC proceeds to finance a commercial contract between the Hydroelectric Power Department (HPD) of Myanmar’s Ministry of Electricity and China National Electric Equipment Corporation (CNEEC), which was signed on March 24, 2004.   On the same day (March 24, 2004), a MOU was signed between Myanmar's Hydroelectric Power Department (HPD), CITIC, Sinohydro regarding the Hydraulic Steel Structure (Lot HSS-2) and Electromechanical Equipment (Lot EM-1) for the Yeywa Hydropower Plant Project. However, it is unclear if Lot HSS-2 and Lot EM-1 were financed by a separate loan.  Then on July 15, 2005, China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC) Technology Co Ltd and Sinohydro Corporation Ltd signed contracts worth $125 million: CITIC agreed to supply $113.13 million worth of generators and transformers and Sinohydro agreed to provide $12.50 million worth of water-gate doors and pipelines. China Gezhouba Water and Power (Group) Co Ltd also signed a contract worth $46.32 million in August 2005 for the construction of a reinforced concrete dam with the supply of machinery equipment. A year later, on September 2, 2005, China National Heavy Machinery Corporation (CHMC) signed contracts with Myanmar's Hydroelectric Power Department (HPD) on the implementation of the Yeywa Hydropower Project. Under the contracts worth $45.84 million, CHMC agreed to supply 230 KV transmission lines and substations for the Yeywa Hydropower Project (as captured via Project ID#64085).   The purpose of the $700 million project was to construct a 790MW hydroelectric power plant on the Myitnge River in Yeywa village, Kyaukse Township, and Mandalay Region. The dam design comprises a 137 meters (449 ft) high RCC embankment gravity dam, built of 2,800,000 cubic meters (99,000,000 cu ft) of concrete. The dam includes an ungated spillway of reinforced conventional concrete cast after RCC placement, located in the central section of the dam for a design flood water discharge of 6,600 cubic meters per second (230,000 cu ft/s). The 448-foot (137 m) wide spillway consists of eight 56-foot (17 m) wide and 39-foot (12 m) high outlets. There is a 790 MW (4 × 197.5 MW) powerhouse at the toe of the dam on the south bank of the river. The power house containing the turbines and generators is 510 feet (160 m) long, 148 feet (45 m) wide and 197 feet (60 m) high. The power house and dam structures are designed to withstand earthquakes of up to eight on the Richter scale. The power generation facilities consist of four water intakes, each consisting of 22-foot (6.7 m) diameter and 492-foot (150 m) long high tensile steel pipe penstocks and four vertical axis Francis turbines and generator units and associated electro-mechanical and auxiliary equipment installed in an open air powerhouse. Four water intake towers were built as conventional reinforced concrete structures abutting the upstream (east) face of the RCC dam. There is one permanent 10-meter (33 ft) diameter, 450-meter (1,480 ft) long, diversion tunnel in the north river bank serving as a bottom outlet. This outlet tunnel enables reservoir drawdown and control during reservoir filling, maintenance of downstream riparian river flow during the impounding period and, together with the spillway, serves to redirect flood waters of the Myitnge river and maintain river flow during an emergency when all turbines are closed down. Two double circuit 230 kV transmission lines connect the main transformers located on the downstream side of the powerhouse to an open-air switchyard, located on the south river bank 550 meters (1,800 ft) downstream of the powerhouse.   The Yeywa Dam supplies electric power to the Meiktila Sub-Power Station through the 110 km (68 mi) long Yeywa-Meiktila 230 kV double power line link to the southwest and to the Bellin Substation through another 50 km (31 mi) long 230 kV double power line link in the west.

Then, in 2004, the Switzerland-based Colenco Power Engineering Ltd completed a project feasibility study.  On June 3, 2005, HPD and Yunnan Machinery and Equipment Import and Export Corporation (YMEC) signed an MOU regarding the 140MW Upper Paunglaung Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project. Then, on February 14, 2006, HPD and YMEC signed an $80 million commercial contract for the project. YMEC also reported provided a supplier credit to HPD to support the implementation of the project, and YMEC in turn financed the supplier credit by securing an export seller’s credit from China Eximbank.  The purpose of the project was to construct a 140MW hydroelectric power plant — with two, 70MW power generation units (Unit 1 and Unit 2) — on Paunglaung Creek. The project site is located 26 miles east of Pyinmana in Mandalay Division (exact locational coordinates:  19.756000, 96.598000) and 24 km upstream from the Paunglaung Dam (captured via Project ID#63813).   The project involved the construction of a 98 meter high RCC dam and a reservoir that stores 1,286 hm3 and extending 50 km. The reservoir was designed to allow the river to be regulated and thereby improve power generation at Lower Paung Laung and increase the irrigation potential further downstream. An above ground power plant is connected to the Lower Paung Laung switchyard via the Nancho hydropower plant by a 27 km long (to Nancho) 230 kV transmission line.   YMEC was the contractor responsible for implementation. Construction began in 2006 and a test run of the spillway was conducted in 2008. The rotor of Unit 1 was hoisted into place on December 2, 2013. The rotor of Unit 2 was hoisted into place on February 22, 2014. A project completion ceremony took place on December 9, 2015. The power plant connected to the national grid on or around December 24, 2015.    This project was plagued by controversy. One report from the civil society group Kayan Women’s Union alleged that the project supported involved forced labor and forced displacement. Another report from Physicians for Human Rights (PHR), Land in Our Hands, and Kayan New Generation Youth documented various human rights violations. The Myanmar Times found that more than 10,000 people from 23 villages were evicted after April 2013 to make place for the large dam. Among the affected groups were ethnic Kayan Lahta, Shan, Burman, and Pa-O. Most were moved to a relocation site near the Lein Li bridge, close to the middle of the reservoir. Residents were not well informed about the displacement process. They first learned about the project when officials came to place markers in their village to assess the water line for the reservoir, some villagers said. Many residents only realized that they would be displaced once construction work had started.  While the government assisted the relocation through the provision of new housing infrastructure and farmland, villagers and civil society groups were deeply concerned about related livelihood losses, provoked by the drowning of traditionally used farming, fishing and forest areas. The relocation sites were hilly and lacked enough fertile plain to offer sufficient land to everybody. Compensation procedures were reported as irregular, corrupt and not transparent. In several cases, the payments were insufficient to cover the costs imposed by the relocation on the villagers."

The borrowing terms of the PBC are unknown. However, it is known that the proceeds of the PBC were to be used by the borrower to partially finance an EPC contact between Union Resources and Engineering Co., Ltd (UREC) and Myanmar’s Ministry of Electric Power, which was signed on January 28, 2011.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 52MW hydroelectric power plant [Baluchaung No.(3) HPP (BLC-3] — with two, 26MW power generation units (Unit 1 and Unit 2) — on the Baluchaung River in Kayah State. The project is located on the right bank of the lower Baluchaung River, its upstream end being located immediately downstream of, and connecting to, the tailrace area of the existing Baluchaung No.(2) Power Station (BLC-2), with the No.(3) Power Station being located some 5.25 km further downstream near the confluence of the Baluchaung River and the Nam Pawn River. The 52MW Baluchaung 3 Hydropower Plant  discharges into the Nam Pawn River a short distance downstream of the confluence with the Baluchaung River.  Baluchaung I-III operate practically on the same river flow since water discharged from the Baluchaung I turbines directly enters the Baluchaung II headrace with virtually no intermediate catchment inflow, and Baluchaung II directly discharges water into the Baluchaung III headrace. The power plants are therefore in practice operated as one. When the central power dispatcher instructs to increase or decrease power from the Baluchaung system, all three power plants need to adjust their operation proportionally.   The cascade utilizes a combined elevation difference of 650 m and generates on average about 1,724 GWh/year, transmitted through two 220 kV transmission lines to Yangon and Swemyo respectively, a 132 kV transmission line to Mandalay, and a 33 kV distribution line to Loikaw and the surrounding area.  UREC was the EPC contractor responsible for the implementation of the 52MW (2x26MW) Baluchaung 3 Hydropower Plant Project. The rotor of Unit 1 was successfully hoisted on September 21, 2013.

This project, which is also known as the Cauchari Solar I, II and III Photovoltaic Parks, involved the installation of 1.2 million solar panels that provide the grid with 312 megawatts of power. Upon completion, the 312 MW complex was expected to generate close to $1 billion in revenue to Jujuy over its first 15 years of operation. It was expected to eventually expand to produce more than 500 megawatts, making it one of the largest solar plants in the world. This photovoltaic park is located in the town of Cauchari.   The provincial energy company, Jujuy State Energy and Mining Society (JEMSE), managed the operation of the solar power complex while construction was executed by Shanghai Electric Power Construction Co. Ltd and Powerchina Ltd. Another Chinese company, Zhongli Talesun Solar Co., Ltd., supplied the 1.18 million solar panels and Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. provided the inverters.   On October 6, 2017, a project construction initiation ceremony was held. The project was officially completed on December 7, 2019.   During the G20 Summit in Argentina from November 30 to December 1, 2018, the Government of Argentina and the People's Republic of China agreed to expand the Cauchari Solar Park in Jujuy, Argentina from a 312 MW solar park to a 500 MW solar park. The Export-Import Bank of China reportedly agreed in principle to issue a $170 million loan (captured via Project ID#69556) to the Government of the Province of Jujuy in Argentina for the 200 MW expansion of the Cauchari Solar Park (known as Cauchari IV and V), which would cover 85% of the total ($200 million) cost of the project. If approved, the China Eximbank loan would require a sovereign guarantee from the central (national) government and carry the following borrowing terms: a 3% interest rate, a 3-year grace period, and a 15-year maturity. The loan approval process will reportedly take up to eight months after a power purchase agreement (PPA) is signed with Cammesa, since China Eximbank will require up to four months to approve the loan. Argentina’s national government will also need up to four months to approve the loan, because it comes with a sovereign guarantee which is already included in the 2021 budget. As of November 2020, the Government of the Province of Jujuy was still negotiating the power purchase agreement (PPA) with Argentina’s energy ministry. If the project is financed, it will also reportedly involve the expansion of a transformer station in Cobos and the construction of a 220-kW high-voltage line from the Altiplano substation to the town of La Quiaca. The addition of another 200 MW will also require the installation of 400,000 panels of a new available technology (500 volt instead of the current 330 volts), on an area of 1,200 hectares."

The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 3% interest rate.  Also, on May 24, 2008, China Eximbank and the Government of Gabon also signed a USD-denominated preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement worth $300 million for the 160MW Grand Poubara Hydroelectric Dam Construction Project. The borrowing terms of the PBC are unknown. The proceeds from the GCL and the PBC were used to finance approximately $370 million of a $398 million Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contract with Sinohydro. The Government of Gabon covered the remaining $28 million cost of the EPC contract.  The Government of Gabon also issued sovereign guarantees for the two loans from China Eximbank.  Project ID#85 captures the GCL, while Project ID#73173 captures the PBC.   The project involved the construction of a dam on the Ogooué river with 4 Francis turbines capable of generating 160 MW. The dam was built in part to generate power for an iron ore mine in Belinga (see Project ID#630).  The project also involved the construction of two power transmission lines: a 15 km line from the dam site to Franceville, the country's third largest city, and another line from the dam site to Moanda (the largest manganese mining region in Gabon and in the world).  The dam is located 15 km outside of Franceville in the province of Haut-Ogooué, more than 700 km southwest of Libreville, an area where the Compagnie minière de l’Ogooué’s (COMILOG) main manganese mine is located.

Under the financing arrangement, AIIB, EBRD, and BSTDB issued loans worth $100 million, $60 million, and $20 million, respectively. Isbank issued a $90 million loan, while ICBC Turkey issued a $30 million loan and Industrial Development Bank of Turkey (TSKB) issued a $50 million loan. These loans carried maturity lengths of 11.5 years.   The purpose of the project is to finance the expansion of a 97 MW geothermal power project located in the region of Aydin, Western part of Turkey. The expansion involves the construction of three additional binary GPP units — namely, the 22.6MW Efe-6, the 25MW Efe-7, and the 50MW Efe-8 — along with associated transmission lines, boreholes (22 production wells and 20 reinjection wells), and a pipeline network interconnecting the powerhouse and production wells. The primary infrastructure of the project includes the power plant units consisting of conventional steam turbines, borewells, pipelines, and emergency ponds to collect the geothermal fluids during a crisis. The electricity generated by Efe-6 is fed to the national grid via the existing 3.9km-long 154kV overhead transmission line of the Gürmat-1 GPP, while Efe-8 will use the existing 154kV Gürmat-2 transmission line. Interconnection with the transmission grid requires the construction of two new switchyards adjacent to the Efe-6 and Efe-8 site. Efe-7 is interconnected to the grid without any switchyard using a 31.5kV underground cable system that is 0.9km-long. The project is expected to help Turkey achieve a stable baseload geothermal power generation capacity of 810 gigawatt-hours (GWh) a year in 2022.   Dse Enerji was responsible for project implementation. The project was prepared in accordance with the EBRD Environmental and Social Policy (EBRD E&S Policy) and the EBRD Performance Requirements (EBRD PRs). The Project was placed in Category “A", in accordance with the EBRD E&S Policy, due to risks associated with the over-ground network of connecting pipelines, their location near populated areas and agricultural land, cumulative land take of the project company’s geothermal power plants and operational carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) emissions. The project was subject to a national Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) procedure and permits were granted by the MoEU for Efe-6, Efe-7 and Efe-8 Geothermal Power Plants (GPPs). The MoEU's approval of the Efe-8 EIA was challenged by a local CSO in Aydin in July 2017 in the local Administrative Court, which revoked the approval in September 2018. An appeal decision by the Chamber of the Council of State reversed the lower court's decision in December 2018, thus rendering the initial granting of the EIA approval valid and in effect while sending back the case to the lower court for re-examination and rendering of a further decision. With this Council of State decision, the project company could proceed with the construction of Efe-8 on the ground of the initial EIA approval; however, the approval needed to be reconfirmed by the Administrative Court. The ESIA prepared in accordance with EBRD’s standards for the original Gürmat-2 project and an ESIA Addendum for the expansion project were disclosed on the EBRD’s website respectively on September 24, 2014 and November 13, 2018. Additional due diligence was undertaken in 2019 following stakeholder concerns and updates on the project permitting resulting in additional mitigation measures. As required by the Lenders, an independent consultant was retained by the project company in 2019 to conduct an Environmental and Social Due Diligence (ESDD) of the project and prepare an Environmental and Social Assessment (ESA), Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP), and Non-Technical Summary (NTS). The ESDD confirmed that the project’s existing and anticipated environmental and social risks and impacts have not materially changed since the ESIA Addendum disclosure in November 2018, but the scrutiny on the industry across Turkey and challenges to geothermal operations in the Germencik region had heightened. It also confirmed that the project was not expected to have any impacts on any protected areas, and it was not expected to be associated with any resettlement. The project was structured to comply with the EBRD's PRs and national requirements. The ESDD also confirmed the project company’s track record in implementing an Environmental, Health, Safety and Social Management System (EHSSMS) in line with the national legislation and familiarity with good international industry practice. However, additional areas for improvement were identified during the ESDD and an updated Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) were developed and disclosed to ensure that the project and operations followed the EBRD's PRs. Measures to mitigate environmental and social impacts during construction, operation, and in case of incidents such as leakage of geothermal fluids, and to strengthen stakeholder outreach were included in the design of the project and relevant 2019 E&S documentation disclosed on the EBRD’s and Company’s website in English and Turkish. As per the 2018 ESIA addendum and confirmed by the 2019 ESA, land acquisition for the project was completed on a willing-buyer/willing-seller basis, and no direct/indirect physical displacement or disruptions in livelihood occurred. Compensation was assessed by the EBRD to have been satisfactory. Outstanding land acquisition for Efe-8's transmission line by the national power distribution company will be monitored by the Company for compliance with PR1 and PR5.   The Efe-6 unit came online in August 2017, followed by the Efe-7, which began commercial operations in October 2018. The environmental impact assessment (EIA) of the Efe-8 was approved after reconsideration by the Turkish government in December 2018. EMRA issued the license for the final unit in 2019. The expansion was originally expected to reach completion with the commissioning of Efe-8 in October 2020. Efe-8 ultimately came online in January 2021."

67343,NULL,"ICBC contributes $89.2 million to syndicated loan for 124MW Menzelet and 54MW Kılavuzlu hydroelectric power plant privatization",2018,Turkey,"In March 2018, ICBC Turkey and several other lenders provided a dual currency syndicated loan to Menzelet Kılavuzlu Elektrik Üretim — a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and wholly-owned subsidiary of ENTEK Electric Uretimi (Üretim) A.S. — for the privatization (i.e. acquisition of operating rights from the Privatization Administration of Turkey) of the 124MW Menzelet and 54MW Kılavuzlu hydroelectric power plants. The loan carried a 13-year maturity and 1-year grace period. It included a USD-denominated tranche worth $399,9000,000 and a Turkish lira-denominated tranche worth TRY 1,530,000,000. Participants in the loan syndicate included ICBC Turkey, EBRD, Türkiye Garanti Bankasi A.Ş. (Garanti), Yapi ve Kredi Bankasi A.Ş. (Yapi Kredi), Türkiye Iş Bankasi A.Ş. (Isbank), Unicredit S.p.A., and Akbank T.A.Ş. In total, ICBC reportedly contributed $89.2 million to the loan syndicate.   The Menzelet and Kilavuzlu hydroelectric power plants are located in the Kahramanmaras province in Turkey’s southeast. Menzelet has a total installed capacity of 124 MW and Kilavuzlu a total installed capacity of 54 MW. Entek Elektrik Üretimi A.S. was the winning bidder of a competitive privatization tender from the Privatization Administration of Turkey in September 2017. Final approval for the tender was issued December 5, 2017. Final privatization occurred March 9, 2018. The privatization tender handed the plants over for 49 years of operation. This project was part of the Turkish government's strategy of privatizing state-owned assets, including hydropower plants, in order to liberalize the country’s energy sector. In addition, most of the project's products will be sold on the wholesale market with no long-term public offtake commitment, contributing to liquidity in the market."
67350,2482,"ICBC contributes to $1.018 billion syndicated loan for Kazan Soda Ash and Power Station Project (Linked to Project ID#92199)",2017,Turkey,"On March 25, 2014, a syndicate of banks including the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), the Export-Import Bank of China, and the Singapore Branch of Deutsche Bank signed a $1.018 billion syndicated buyer’s credit loan agreement with Kazan Soda Elektrik Üretim A.Ş. — a special purpose vehicle and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ciner Holding that was established on February 11, 2011 — for the Kazan Soda Ash and Power Station Project. Because the individual contributions of the banks are unknown, AidData assumes equal contributions ($339,333,333) across the three members of the loan syndicate. Project ID#67350 records ICBC’s contribution, and Project ID#92199 records China Eximbank’s contribution. This loan carried the following borrowing terms: a maturity period of 13 years, a grace period of 4 years, and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 3.45% margin. Park Holding A.Ş., WE Soda Kimya Yatırımları A.Ş., and Ciner Kimya Yatırımları A.Ş. issued corporate guarantees in support of the loan. The borrower also purchased a buyer’s credit insurance policy from Sinosure. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by Kazan Soda Elektrik Üretim A.Ş. to finance 85% of the cost of a commercial contract with China Tianchen Engineering Co., Ltd. Repayment of the loan commenced on December 20, 2018 and was scheduled to continue until June 20, 2027. The loan’s amount outstanding as of December 31, 2019 was $800.5 million; of December 13, 2020 was $736.8 million.   The Kazan Soda Ash and Power Station Project had three components: mining, processing, and cogeneration. While the mining area is located in Kahramankazan district, the production plant is situated within the Sincan district of Ankara Province, northwest of Ankara. It is about 35 km (22 mi) north of Ankara. The plant's mining section supplies the processing section with the trona solution (trisodium hydrogendicarbonate dihydrate), which is the primary source of soda ash. For this, trona ore, laying on average at a depth of 600 m (2,000 ft) underground, is injected with hot water through boreholes drilled, and the dissolved trona is pumped up in the form of trona solution. The plant has five processing lines. The congeneration facility produces 380 MWe electric power and 400 tons of steam. Upon completion, it was expected that the annual production capacity of the plant would reach 2.5 million tons of soda ash (sodium carbonate, Na2CO3) and 200,000 tons of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO3), and Ciner Group would become the world's largest soda ash producer (Note: Natural soda ash is more environmentally friendly than the corresponding synthetic alternatives in terms of waste and energy consumption).   China Tianchen Engineering Co., Ltd. was the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor responsible for implementation. Financial and contract works for the project started in 2013, and a turnkey construction contract for the processing facility, mining facility, and cogeneration power plant was signed in November 2014. Construction, assembly, and manufacturing activities were carried out in 2015-2016. Provisional acceptance of 271 MW gas turbine unit was achieved on August 18, 2017, and the facility started commercial production on August 19, 2017. This plant was officially opened on January 15, 2018. It is now the biggest soda ash production facility in Europe. With both Kazan Soda and Eti Soda, Ciner Holding has become the leading soda ash producer of the world. The total annual export value of the products from Kazan Soda Elektrik and Eti Soda is $800 million."
